    "group_description": "The QNAPCrypt ransomware works similarly to other ransomware, including encrypting all files and delivering a ransom note. However, there are several important differences:1. The ransom note was included solely as a text file, without any message on the screen—naturally, because it is a server and not an endpoint.2. Every victim is provided with a different, unique Bitcoin wallet—this could help the attackers avoid being traced.3. Once a victim is compromised, the malware requests a wallet address and a public RSA key from the command and control server (C&C) before file encryption.",
