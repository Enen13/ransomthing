victim: i can't prove it. we're gonna have to trust each other. victim: if you want to pay, then this is the only way to come to an agreement. so that emotions are not used in the negotiations, i am here as an intermediary. my client doesn't want to negotiate, even though it seems to be the only option. although they have backups, but the restoration will take some time, so i would like to negotiate an adequate price. gang: you cant prove it because you don't know it. this is just confirmed our doubts have a nice day. victim: we are a protected society and i cannot afford to openly write who it is. i only know the owner of the company who owns several companies. victim: if you do not want to cooperate, then i will pass this information on to the customer and the media to make it obvious that blackmatter are a group of crooks. gang: this is ridiculous, you can prove it in hundreds different ways, without compromising so called privacy . victim: give an example.i only know the owners of the companies. gang: to start a cooperation, we have to know with whom we a dealing and you failing it. so far you looks as some boring guy who got a sample from virus total and obtained the chat link. victim: they found this file in their system and that's why i came to your page c: [redacted].readme.txt gang: you can upload the company s letterhead, you can tell to us domain controllers name, name of backing up software it is just a few victim: actually i don't have much time to deal with authorization. i want to help the customer and negotiate the terms of cooperation. just because anyone can watch this chat, i don't want to share any information and prove that i am who i am. do you want to negotiate the price? gang: so far it looks as your main objective is to f ck with us victim: the environment is isolated and analyzed by the forensics team and the police. i can't interfere with the investigation, and all the documentation has been encrypted, as the customer told me. victim: i certainly don't feel like fucking with you. i want to talk and get this thing resolved as soon as possible. gang: here we go again, to negotiate with whom with some random joe? gang: ok, this is simple prove you are from company or just go grab another sample from vt. victim: yes, let's talk about price and what you get for our data. then we can discuss the price of the decryptor. victim: what is vt? gang: oh [redacted] you so clever virustotal.com victim: oh, i see. so how do we do it? gang: you have the options 1. internal windows domain name. 2. domain administrators name. 3. backup software name. this information aren t locked by encrypting software or police victim: 1 [redacted] victim: 2 administrator gang: 2 administrator this is too generic give us another one victim: [redacted] gang: ok, john thank you. so you see the price, you need to pay it. victim: are we really not? this bill was sent to me by their owner. i'm gonna look like a fool if we don't agree on a price. gang: your english is too sophisticated for me, can you try again victim: are we really not? this account was sent by their owner. if we don't make a deal, i'm gonna look like an idiot. victim: i don't speak english, so i translate automatically. gang: you see the demanded price. if you ll pay it you will get. 1. the decrypting tools. 2. your data back we took 1.5tb, pii, nda, emails, mssql databases 3. a file tree. 4. explanation how the company was breached. victim: the price is not adequate. give me a price i can pass on to the owner of the company. gang: we have no idea what a price is adequate for you. we can make 10 discount for fast payment and remove 25 btc transaction fee. make the offer. but to make it simple we will not consider the offer less than 7-figure number. victim: our idea was 500,000, but we can negotiate a price of 1,000,000. give us proof that there is information sensitive enough to be of such value. gang: do you want me upload a sample with office documents? the emails and sqls are too big but we have them all. gang: one more detail we know the company doesn't have the backups. rubrik is gone victim: we have offline backups. ok show me the office document and a screenshot of the database. victim: do you also have the passwords of the domain users? give me a screenshot. gang: you have tapes for [redacted] but they are useless without software. gang: this is the screenshot for da hashes and passwords. https: ibb.co [redacted] victim: we have a backup created by other software and transferred to a san to a backup data center. restoration will take a long time, but it is possible. what databases do you have? gang: yo can get the sample by following link. https: privatlab.com m v [redacted] we will not make db screenshots too much work. gang: we have dbs from [redacted]sql sql2014test [redacted]sql1 [redacted]-sql [redacted]-sql victim: data in databases should be encrypted. just because you have database servers doesn't mean anything. gang: should or is? victim: according to it, it should be. let's make a deal like this. if the data in the database is encrypted, we'll pay you 100,000 to decrypt it for us. if the data in the databases is not encrypted, then we'll pay you 700,000. 700,000 is the price we have to invest in recovery, and if the recovery with the decryptor is faster, then we'll save money on service outages. gang: to complicated, we said what will provide if we ll agree on price. 700k is unacceptable. victim: okay, then the price is 1,000,000 if the data is readable. gang: without any conditions, you are paying for decrypting tools and fast recovery, the data is collateral. you will not recover so easily without decryptor. we can do negotiations pretty long; time is on our side. if you are want to finish this fast make the acceptable offer. victim: the data you hold is worse for us than having to recover it. the data you hold is worth no more than 1,000,000, which is why we are offering this price. we can restore the data from offline backups we have tested this . a higher price than 1,000,000 is not acceptable to us. if you don't accept this price, then i need to check with the owner of the company what we will do next and if we can offer more money. gang: how you evaluate data s price can i see a formula? gang: you can do incremental and we can do decremental steps, make the offer that we can turn down. 1 is to far away from 15. victim: we evaluate it subjectively. we have already written to people about pii, so the reputational impact has already occurred. we're gonna put new passwords in active directory. office documents aren't that valuable to us. the only thing of value is the databases. victim: 15 is meaningless. i thought 15 was just a number, but not the actual ransom. gang: we just checked the random db, data is fine and not encrypted. have a look. https: ibb.co [redacted] victim: i understand, but for us only the know-how and customer information in the databases is worth anything. victim: i can see it now. then name a price that makes sense for both sides. gang: nothing sn meaningless, we did a good pentest for your company it has to be rewarded. 1kk is not enough. do some consultations and come with a better offer. gang: one of your competitors was hit the same yesterday if it helps to your feelings. gang: if you will offer the good price today we can make a decent discount for you. victim: i need to check with the management and the owners. what competitor do you think? gang: by the way they offer much more then you. victim: i guess they don't have backup. gang: you either, you tried to do it on sunday but you know what has happened. victim: we are restoring. i'm gonna go talk to the management. gang: https: ibb.co [redacted]",1,-0.31,cold threat

gang: how many virtual machines have you failed to recover? were they on the same esxi? gang: you showed me a log in which the decryptor is trying to decrypt empty files. so the problem arose before decryption. why so, i can not answer you, there can be a lot of reasons. gang: if you have any other problems with decryption - i will help you, just give me not empty files. victim: the empty file has data of creation on 15nov in the night victim: i don't know why victim: there is a format job runnin victim: i need your little but useful help. on veem the volume where we have the backup , this morning was accessible but now the volume is raw. gang: i don't quite understand what you mean victim: the tool that you used to encrypt our backup. at the end of encrypion does it do disprutive action? gang: no, it doesn't. if backups are on windows - use the windows decryptor. gang: never interrupt the decryption process by closing the program manually. the program may freeze during decryption, this is normal. victim: hi. victim: we trusted in you victim: but we need some files that miss gang: we gave you decryptors and they work, if you have problems with them, i will help you. gang: before buying decryptors, you saw that some files were empty and you could not pay. gang: we fulfilled our part of the deal, i don't know why you have empty files. you didn't even tell me how many there are.",1,0.39,merciful

and about the three files what is the procedure? gang: as for the files, if you need a proof we indeed possess your data, send me a couple of directories to the files you want to see. we can provide you with a 20,000 discount if you pay us this week. the price is fair for your company. victim: we are willing to cooperate, but the amount requested is far beyond our capabilities as a small company. we can offer a smaller sum and pay it as soon as possible. additionally, we need to clearly understand the payment process and the guarantees we have to securely recover our data. please provide detailed instructions on how to proceed and assure us that we will receive all our data without further issues gang: i can't give you an additional discount until i see your number. the price can be increased at any second if you keep haggling like this. victim: what number do you mean? gang: the number you are ready to pay at the moment. victim: we can offer 120,000 and want to be transparent, avoiding a prolonged negotiation. additionally, we need to understand how to make the payment. we will provide several files for you to decrypt to verify your capabilities. gang: 120,000 is not a bad offer but i can't accept this. i also want to avoid a prolonged negotiation, so our final price is 150,000. you have 2 days to gather the rest 30k and we will be done with it. i will give you our wallet for payment later. victim: we are agreeable to proceeding with the following conditions: first, we will provide several encrypted files for you to decrypt as proof of your decryption capabilities. following this, we will make an initial payment of 120,000 in exchange for the instructions and necessary tools to decrypt the rest of our systems. once we have successfully recovered our data, we will make a final payment of 30,000. in return, we expect a report detailing how the attack was carried out and confirmation that all our data has been removed from your possession and any related systems victim: [provides a zip archive of encrypted files] gang: tell is there the file named auth.log.fog.savepoint somewhere near the file auth.log.fog ?

do we have that all our data will be fully recovered and secured? we also want to understand what you will provide to us after the payment. please understand that we are concerned due to our lack of experience with situations like this and need reassurance that everything will be resolved properly. gang: once the payment is made, you will get the .exe files that you will need to run on your systems win or esxi to decrypt your files. we guarantee that you will be able to recover all the encrypted data. we will give you a deletion log file which means the files we stole .were removed from our source. victim: we need to finalize the financial and legal aspects on our end before proceeding with the payment. once everything is ready and the payment is made, we will notify you immediately. gang: standing by, thanks. victim: we are currently reviewing the payment method, and since we are not familiar with this process, we are unsure how to proceed. could you explain how this is typically done and which services are usually used? we want to ensure that everything is handled correctly. gang: see the link https: www.csoonline.com article 570047 how-to-buy-bitcoin-for-ransomware-payment-if-you-must.html victim: thanks ,we are checking, but the registration process and validation will take some time. gang: sure gang: how's your progress with that? victim: the cryptocurrency purchase platform needs to verify the user, and this won't be completed until tomorrow. the process is turning out to be quite long and complex for us. gang: tell me when you have updates victim: sure victim: we have conducted an initial test to verify that the process we're following is correct. could you confirm that you have received the first transfer of 5? meanwhile, we are in the process of acquiring the total amount of cryptocurrency needed for the full payment, but it is taking some time. gang: i received 0.000082 victim: okay, we are in the process of obtaining the full amount. once we have it, we will proceed with the transfer. victim: once the payment is received, what are the next steps? gang: i will give you the decrypter after i see the money in the wallet gang: and instructions of course victim: we are gathering the payment in the exchange, but we need to proceed gradually with the euro money transfers to the wallet. i believe we can have it ready in less than 48 hours. maybe in 24 hours. i'll keep you informed. victim: from the moment we make the payment transfer, how long will it take you to send me the decryptors for windows files and virtual machines? will you send them here, or should i give you an email? gang: i will send the decrypters via this chat after full sum received victim: hi, i already have the funds available. i'm going to make a small test transfer from this wallet, and then the rest will be ok? gang: sure. but you have already sent a test amount of 0.000082 btc. anyway, you can send another one. victim: please give me 3 hours and we will proceed. i write to you here. thank you. gang: standing by. victim: hi, we just did the test transfer. please tell me everything is ok. victim: when you verify it we make the final large transfer. gang: i see 0.003 confirming victim: ok sr. victim: we proceed to make the payment. can you confirm that i will have the decrypters instantly please?

gang: if your next step will be above six number sum, i'll ask my team if there any additional discount possible. victim: thank you for the consideration. my team is working on seeing what more we can do. at the moment i ve only been able to pull together 75k. we just need more time. gang: update us on monday. victim: hello, we've been working on this all weekend and here's what we've been able to do, we can come up to the 6 figure number and offer 100,000, but this is all we will probably have for quite some time. please consider our offer and let's gt a deal done. gang: the upper management has decided to provide you with 30,000 discount coming down to 220,000 amount. you can handle this sum with no harm to your business, let's get this over. victim: while we appreciate the further reduction, we simply don't have that much onhand and it's going to take quite some time to get any more than we currently have. gang: you have until friday. victim: we are really wanting to get this done quickly, but we simply don't have what you are asking for and we don't know where or how we are going to get any more than the 100,000 that we've offered. we've used up all of our sources of cash. we can send you all of this now, but i don't know when or if we'll have anymore. gang: you still have time until friday to get more funds. let's see what you will get and decide how to continue our deal. victim: we are still trying to raise further funds, but we aren't having a lot of luck. we'll let you know where we are at tomorrow. gang: ok, standing by. victim: ok, so we now have 150,000 and just want to get this done and behind us. this is basically splitting the difference between your price and our's. please consider our offer, help us out, and let us get on with our business. thanks for your consideration gang: hello gang: the leadership has agreed to accept your offer. here is the btc wallet id for payment: [redacted] how soon are you going to fund our wallet?

gang: 850,000 for the full deal. the post will be removed after payment only. victim: we apologize for the delay. internal discussions were necessary to determine a viable offer. considering current constraints, your initial demand exceeds our capabilities. our proposal for the full deal is 150,000 usd. also, we kindly request the temporary removal of the public post during negotiations as a sign of good faith. while we cannot guarantee immediate payment, we are committed to resolving this matter as quickly as possible. gang: we will temporarily remove the post. thank you for your offer but it can't be considered. the leadership is willing to come down to 800,000 as a sign of good faith. victim: thank you again for your cooperation and for temporarily removing the post. after further internal discussions, our limitations remain significant due to bureaucratic approvals and cryptocurrency transfer restrictions. nevertheless, in the spirit of progressing towards a mutually acceptable resolution, we can increase our offer slightly to 162,000 usd. we kindly ask for your understanding regarding these economic realities and bureaucratic challenges, including the complexity of transferring funds into cryptocurrency. we remain fully committed to reaching an agreement promptly. gang: thank you. a 12,000 step doesn't look fair. we're willing to reach an agreement promptly but it won't be in the 150-300k range, you must understand. we can provide additional 50k discount, so let's not complicate things. we're well aware of bureaucratic challenges. hope you will break them quick. victim: thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. to clarify our financial position further, our organization operates in an economically developing country in latin america, where profit margins are limited, and most earnings are immediately reinvested into business growth and essential operations. even significantly reducing these activities wouldn t allow us to substantially exceed our current offer. we appreciate your additional discount, yet due to the economic realities and constraints already shared, we simply cannot approach your proposed range. our current offer reflects a realistic effort under these conditions. we remain committed and sincerely interested in promptly resolving this matter within our available means. gang: we don't want you take this as a threat but we think your management don't fully understand the consequences that could appear after our further actions. let me clarify something more: the personal data of your employees, clients and partners, now at our hands. but if you don't pay, it will be released to public. at the most basic level, they face the risk of identity theft, which can manifest in unauthorized loans, financial losses, and other forms of personal fraud. because your files are saturated with financial data as well, it makes such scenario even more possible. but the risks don't stop at financial implications. with such data. we are willing to give it back, but if it gets published, more even criminals can engage in targeted blackmail schemes, zeroing in on employees, especially those holding pivotal positions within the company. by doing so, they or we could coerce your people into acting against your company's best interests. moreover, the exposure of personal details like home addresses or daily routines could pose a direct threat to the physical safety of employees, making them vulnerable to potential harm or intimidation drawings, logos, formats, internal mail correspondence with your clients and employees, email templates with authentic templates and structures. now when we have your templates, we can weaponize them to launch convincing phishing attacks if you don't pay. we will mislead employees, clients, or vendors into unintentionally opening our malware and ransomware. this use of your templates can harm your reputation as well. your stakeholders will begin to question the company's integrity and ability to safeguard critical information, leading to an erosion of trust. accounting files, documents, and audits. when this financial information becomes public on our blog, competitors, upon obtaining this data, could gain invaluable insights into your company's financial health and strategic direction making. such knowledge would offer them an undue competitive advantage, potentially undermining the company's market position. furthermore, regulatory bodies might penalize the company for failing to adequately safeguard sensitive data, leading to hefty fines and further erosion of stakeholder trust. try to calculate possible loses from lawsuits, penalties and total loss of your clients. reputational damage for your business is really deadly. you have to estimate this payment not as a loss or ransom, it is your investment in your company's future. without getting a deal here your business is fated. gang: we need further increase from your side to consider any discounts. victim: thank you for clearly outlining the risks involved and your concerns. we have carefully evaluated the situation and fully understand the severity. as previously mentioned, our organization operates in an economically developing country, with most of our profits consistently reinvested into business growth and essential operational activities. additionally, the process of converting funds to cryptocurrency involves significant bureaucratic hurdles and limitations on available resources. nevertheless, given the seriousness of the situation, we held another internal meeting and secured approval for an additional increase. after making a substantial effort, our maximum feasible offer has now been raised from 162,000 usd to 200,000 usd. unfortunately, ongoing financial commitments and internal regulations severely limit any possibility of further increments beyond this point. we kindly ask for your understanding, as this represents our absolute maximum effort given the circumstances. we remain fully committed to resolving this matter promptly and appreciate your cooperation. gang: we will discuss this internally. i will get back to you shortly. gang: the leadership is willing to accept 200,000 if you arrange payment within the next 24 hours. here is our btc wallet id for payment:

working to expedite the necessary internal approvals. we greatly appreciate your understanding and cooperation. gang: keep us posted on your progress please. gang: what's your progress? gang: the

gang: this doesn't work. 80,000 offer is too far from our demand. we do not work with 5 figure amounts. update your offer today, if you don't want us to announce the incident. victim: the accountant is still reviewing our financials. it's been even harder since he doesn't have access to some of the drives. this isn't our final number but there's nothing else he can provide today. he's going through dozens of reports and re-calculating some of the locked data so he's going to need a few days to figure this out. gang: we will not give more than 24 hours. hurry up. victim: if we keep getting these short deadlines, then we're going to continue coming up short. it's just a few of us that work here and each day has been painful for us. we don't have access to our files and we're trying to come up with a price that feels unfair. if you're not going to meet us on the price, then please give us enough time to actually give you a proper response. we don't need a whole week, just a few days. gang: you have the deadline. no one is going to drag this out. victim: so we have like 2-3 days? that's all we need. gang: no, we can't give you 3 days. update us on tuesday evening. we will decide how to proceed with you. victim: we'll try but we really don't know what we can come up with in a few hours... gang: you have to take it seriously. we will not wait long. victim: ok this is where we're at. the accountant said that we were already in bad shape to start the year and the budget was trimmed because our profits aren't getting better. we may be able to sideline a small project to come up with more cash for you, but anything more and we're going to need help from the bank. there is nothing else left for now. to sum it up, we can pay 103,000 now. anything more will require help from the bank. gang: this is something already. you can understand that you are still far from our demand but we are open to work with you. so, the leadership decided to make a big step towards you and we are ready to accept 400,000 if you pay this week. victim: 400,000? this week? victim: is this some sort of a trick? how do you think we'll 4x our offer in 3 days? gang: take a loan or try to borrow. ask your accountant. you have a few hundred thousands in cash and a couple of dozens in assets. victim: i don't know much about the financials but i know our accountant has said multiple times that we are already in a lot of debt. if there's any chance of borrowing then that will take time too. i hate sounding like a broken record constantly asking for time, but you need to give us something to work off of. can we get the rest of this week to see our options then update you on monday?

furthermore, post-payment, what level of techsupport can we expect to ensure the functionality of your product? awaiting your detailed response. gang: i'm pretty confident that you will decrypt everything we've encrypted, with our took, but i will ask my tech guys about assurances as well. victim: thankyou gang: well, i got assurance from my tech dept that all of your encrypted files including huge sql server and dbs will be successfully decrypted. if you face any problems during decryption process, we will be here to support 24 7. after payment you will receive decryptors and commands how to run them. we've already decrypted cases where encryption process was interrupted. we have carefully checked encrypted files you gave us for test and are sure there won;t be any problems. gang: we're not interested in deceiving you since it will impact our reputation we honor. victim: we have been discussing your services and after your assurances we feel a lot better with moving forward with an agreement. we can gather and access 208k within the next 24 hours and pay. please work with us here. we do not have a cyber insurance policy to pull funds from, and this is out of pocket cash we have to access. we appreciate that your team will stand behind your service as you value your reputation. gang: in our turn we appreciate your willingness to end this with us but 208k won't resolve the incident. my team is ready to accept 300,000 for the deal this week. this is our final offer. let us get this over. here is our btc wallet [redacted] gang: waiting for your reply guys. victim: thank you for working with us on this incident. please take 271,818.13 in btc to your wallet and let's put the matter behind us. we can all go into our weekend feeling like we worked on this problem together and enjoy life. as soon as you agree, we will start working on getting the btc setup and send it to you. gang: i'll let you know soon. gang: guys, we both know that you are able to close this at 300,000. we've decreased our demand significantly so let's end this at 300k and get this over. i'll wait for a message from you asap. gang: hello. we are waiting for a message from you. victim: i am sitting here waiting for final approval from my boss. please give me a couple of minutes gang: waiting. victim: we will move forward with the 300k payment. we need to be sure that your team will provide the decryption key asap and be available to assist with decryption throughout this weekend and for as soon as our files remain encrypted, you will provide the report on what you found vulnerable in our environment, promise to never attack us again, provide proof of deletion of our files as well as your assurance that our data including that of our clients will not be sold or shared or published, and finally never mention your attack against us to any other person or organization. if we are in agreement we will purchase the bitcoin and provide an initial payment of a small amount to confirm that you received and then make a full payment. gang: great. we confirm the terms. decryptors are ready. the wallet is above. let me know when you make a test transaction. victim: hi friends. first payment on its way. hash: [redacted] victim: are you able to confirm reciept?

you. victim: it is a long weekend holiday in [redacted] and all banks are closed. you can check on google. apart from this, you are making it difficult. how does it hurt you to take us off the blog? i need to show some good faith on your side to make my boss follow. believe me, it will make things much easier. victim: we are willing to make the deal even though it is a significant effort, but to make it easier i need your assistance and consideration. you can always put us back on if things turn sour, which i don't think will happen as we want to make the deal. victim: thank you for your consideration gang: we can remove the post after payment only. the faster you act, the sooner the post will be removed. victim: maybe this is a cultural difference between our cultures. but to strike a deal, which it seems both of us want we need some trust to exist. by not making this very small step towards us it makes my job more difficult. see, in the eyes of my boss you already caused us damage by putting us on. anyhow, as i told you the full availability of management and bank opening is in 5 days. so we have time to work the deal out. victim: asking you to reconsider. thank you. gang: there are no cultural differences between us, it's just the way this business works. you were offering us pennies and was warned about publication. victim: i suppose we are from different parts of the world and we are humans. so cultural difference are built in. but this is philosphy and we are here to do business. you were indeed offered a very modest amount by a colleague of mine. i was indeed unbecoming the situation. i am not him. nevertheless i apologized and am showing significant will to reach a mutually liveable arrangement. to make it easier for me to make the deal and for you to get the money i respectfully asked you to make a mall step and show some good will towards us and me personally. frankly, i do not understand your position. but again we are not here to philisophyze. i hope your position will not make the deal harder to reach. as i said before, the boss sees some damage as already done.i urge you to please rethink your position. gang: i still do not see any decent offer from your side. we will take the post down later. victim: thank you. i take this as a positive sign. as mentioned before [redacted] is in holiday with most people out of reach. doing my best to locate relevant stakeholders to get you a respectful offer. one thing i can say at this point is that you may have a mistake about our corporate identity. maybe you think we are [redacted]. we are not. we are part of the group, but unfortunately for us a smaller and less successful part, at least financially. but again, i'm not running a bazaar here and will be back to you with an offer as soon as i get management approval. looking forward to finalizing a deal. gang: standing by. victim: hello, despite the holiday, we were able to confer with the management and after going through some hurdles to secure an offer of 110,000 one hundred and ten thousand us dollars . it seems respectable when you take into account that we are not the size and financial status you think we are. hope for your understanding and looking forward to finalizing the deal. thank you. gang: thank you for your offer. we're willing to accept 650,000 and get this over with you. victim: thank you. i will confer with the boss and be back to you as soon as i have his answer. gang: we'll wait for your answer today. victim: thank you for the step you have made towards finding a liveable solution. regretably, i must say that the number of 650,000 is waaaay above our capabilities. to illustarate my point, our financial results for the past years are of loss. if you allow me i can upload here the official financial reports, or youn simply google them to see for yourself i am telling the truth. victim: we do want to reach a deal both sides can live with. but 650,000 is a death sentence. in a matter of numbers my boss says he can add another 30,000 to make a total of 140,000. i hope you understand the true situation and the fact that to make it liveable for us and getting some payment for you the numbers have to be significnatly lower than you requested. looking forward for your understamding of the true factual situation. gang: upload your reports, please. meanwhile, i was able to get approval for an additional discount. we're ready to close this at 590,000. gang: the post has been removed but it might be returned at any second. we hope to come to an agreement within 2-3 days and go our separate ways. we need a decent counter offer from your side to make a final step to finalization. victim: thank you for removing the post. as for the numbers, sorry, but it is not even close to our abilities. you are invited to see for yourself. please look at line 21 from the top - profit loss for the year. victim: balance sheet 2023.jpeg 200 kb gang: thank you for the report but it seems like a trick, we were waiting for verified signed documents. anyway, even if it is true, we do not have real picture your savings, your investments, your net assets etc. . we believe we're asking for a fair amount and are willing to close the deal. victim: you are most invited to go online and check if it is a trick. it is certainly not. your demand is not even close to what we are able to pay. i suppose you invested some funds into breaching us, your best chnace of having a return on your investment is by coming closer to what we actually are able to pay. my boss thinks he made a fair offer. we only ask for a feasible offer from you. the current one is not something we can live with. gang: i simply do not know how to help you. you can sell some of your assets or something but my bosses can't go lower than 350,000. victim: thank you for your offer. i will go back to my boss and try to work it out. eventually we want this deal to happen. gang: let me know asap. victim: hello and thank you for your patience. the boss is seeking creative ways to raise additional funds. complicated as there are no banks yet due to the holiday.we are into making this deal, as long as the required funds could be allocated. gang: we have until friday to get this over with. please speed things up on your part. victim: hello and thank you for the significant step you have taken towards us and towards a mutually liveable solution to the situation. unfortunately, the results of us scraping our finances come to a top of about 180,000. i know it is well below your last offer, but maybe if we only go for the part of securing our data and forget the decrypting part your bosses will accept it. i do afraid that if we don't reach an agreement both you and us stay with nothing. an agreement will let us alive and you still get money. if we agree the transfer could be made on a short schedule. expecting your consideration to finally get ovet this. thank you. gang: we appreciate your efforts to end this with us. the lowest number we can accept for the case is 250,000. not less. we can give you until friday to make the payment, since our dialogue is long enough and we need to close the case. victim: understood. just to make it clear, 250,000 for the full package. decryption data deletion. right? gang: yes. victim: understood. thank you. will ge the fianl hopefully today. meanwhile, and i apologize if this is a dumb question, how does the payment mechanism work? i understand we need to get bitcoin. what happens next? gang: we need your decision today. to gain bitcoins you need to go to any exchange platform as binance or coinbase. here are the guides: https: www.coinbase.com how-to-buy bitcoin https: www.binance.com en how-to-buy bitcoin you also can buy bitcoin from any local brokers. if you withdraw funds from your bank account, then you have to inform the bank that you need this money for investment purposes only. once we get payment, we will provide the decryptors for each of your systems immediately. victim: got. it. the boss approved the deal. we need now to better understand how it works. i understand you want the payment first and then you provide the decryptor. would that be right? victim: if so, how do i know we will actually get the decryptor after we send you the payment? victim: is there like a trusted third party we could send the funds to? then they tell you they have the funds, you send the decryptor and after we confirm it works the third party sends you the money? gang: we value our reputation and honor all agreements made. you will not find a single case where we have broken an agreement or failed to fulfill any of the clauses. after payment you will receive a decryptor for each of your systems and manual on how to use it for particular file system. if you face any problems during decryption process, we will be here to support. you will receive a deletion log which means the raid drives that contained the only copy of your data are fully formatted and erased. you will receive a security report that includes information about how we were able to penetrate your network, as well as exclusive first-hand information about the state of your network, the vulnerabilities that we found. what's more, you'll receive high-quality technical recommendations on eliminating any vulnerabilities and strengthening your network to secure your internal and external infrastructure. you will also receive written guarantees that we will not sell or publish your data, keep this conversation private, and delete this chat later. we won't come back for more money after payment and we won't attack you again. victim: understood. thank you. another question, do you accept only bitcoin or is usdt is also an option. a friend told me it more stable than bitcoin. victim: also please mind that is is already evening in [redacted] and the banks are closed. they open tomorrow morning and as i understand that this size of a transaction could take 3-4 business days. gang: we accept btc only. we expect to get payment before the weekend. victim: will do bitcoin, but payment can hardly be completed before weekend. simply no physical time to reach this destination. we are a company, there is a procedure to get such a large amount of money moved. victim: also, the commissions on buying bitcoin are simply shoking. for an amount of 250,000 it could get to 25,000. this is simply crazy. please consider having 250,000 including the transaction fees. otherwise the while deal might fall. we are doing our best, but no one considered these crazy fees. please... gang: come on, mates. if there is no payment by the weekend, we will have to raise the price to 275,000 on monday. please speed things up on your part. victim: sir, i am not joking. you and i worked hard to make a fir deal. following the path you suggested of raising the price would only ruin everything and we all lose. victim: sorry, a fair deal victim: if i may suggest another approach that might make us cut on some time would be for you to accept the price we agreed upon of 250,000 when it includes preset commission of let's say 25,000 and make the deal before monday. meaning you receive 225,000 bu on a much faster route. otherwise, if we do it through the company, there is no chance to pay before monday at the earliest. maybe even tuesday victim: as it was mentioned before, we just had a long holiday and the system is just coming back to work. it takes time to move funds if this is done through the company. victim: i urge your consideration to save this deal on which you and i worked so hard to achieve. gang: i'll let you know a bit later. victim: thank you. we are ready to move on. just say in what direction gang: are you able to send 225,000 today? if so, we're willing to accept. victim: thak you, this will help us save the deal. we are in the process of getting the bitcoin. as you know the transaction also take time. i would say we will be ok until tomorrow morning. do we have a deal? if so, please send the wallet address so we could send you the first 1,000 to make sure it all works. thank you. gang: we do have a deal. here is our btc wallet [redacted] let me know when you are ready to make a test transaction. victim: thank you. test transaction to wallet [redacted] to be initiated in the next 40 minutes. will come back to confirm sending the payment and expect you confirming. gang: 0.016 btc unconfirmed. you can proceed with the rest. victim: ok. this is about 1030. remaining 223,970 victim: do you mind if we start moving the payment in parts as the bitcoin is purchased? thank you. gang: we don't mind. anyway, you will receive everything once we get payment in full. victim: understood. didn't think a seaoned businessman like you will say otherwise ;- victim: my mother says that in russian there is a term called tertiy kalach to describe a seasoned man. isn't it? victim: transfer made. please confirm. victim: confirmation of second batch? thank you gang: 0.57 received. proceed please. victim: a total of 0.5873577 bitcoin which is 37,713 transferred. reamaining 187,287. to be followed as agreed, though the broker says blockchain is very busy today and delays are to be expected. not up to us. gang: ok. keep me posted. victim: hello. i know things are running late, but it is not us. we have made the purchases of the coins but the broker says there is a crazy traffic jam in the blockchain what ever it means. we are waiting for it to come through. we've been on this most of the night but this is totally out of our control. doing all in our control to see the deal through. asking for your understanding on the issue. victim: i also understand that there is some usdt in our posession that could account for a significant percent of the deal if you could accept usdt instead of the bitcoin. i know that for some reason you do not like usdt bu this seems to be a way to get you more funds on a shoorter schedule. awaiting your word. thank you. victim: ok. it seems t eh traffic is easing. reay to send you additional funds. please confirm it is received. victim: funds sent to wallet [redacted] victim: please disregard message that money was sent. clisked submit by mistake. please confirm the wallet address is still valid. victim: i dont want to cause any delays in making our deal. making the transfer to the wallet you have sent yesterday. please confirm receiving the funds. thank you victim: funds sent to wallet [redacted] victim: waiting to make another bitcoin transfer. please confirm the previous one. thank you gang: we have received 2.66385307 btc in total. please proceed further. victim: that means you have about 172,229 and we still need to pay 52771 which is about 0.828613 or roughly 0.83 btc. and then the deal is paid. please confirm. thank you victim: we are ready to make the last payment. just confirm the numbers. thank you. gang: the balance is 2.66385307 btc or 169,553 at this moment. so you need to send 55,447. we are waiting. thank you. victim: payment on its way. please confirm arrival. thank you. gang: received. please wait. gang: unlocker.7z 1.79 mb gang: unlocker.exe -p path to unlock unlocker.exe -s c: paths.txt where paths.txt is a list of paths for the decryptor, each path on a new line esxi commands 1 chmod x

victim: what about the things i mentioned? thank you. gang: we will provide within 24 hours. thank you for your patience. victim: ok. standing by. victim: hello. there seems to be a problem with operating the tool you have sent. our it guys say that to run it they need to log in to the main esx server. the problem is that they say you have changed the password of the server so they cannot log in. what is the new password you have set? thank you. gang: i'll let you know soon. victim: thank you. our it guys were eventually able to login, but when running the unlocker file they say it does not decrypt. the files stay with the .akira extension. could it be that by mistake you sent an encryptor and ot a decryptor? gang: wait a bit. gang: there was a little mistake here. here is the correct unlocker. gang: win unlocker.ex 759 kb gang: let me know if you have troubles. victim: thank you. hope it works... victim: hello. you promised proof of data deletion within 24 hours. when will we have it? thank you? victim: also, please check with your tech people, it seems you have changed the root password to the esxi server. could you please send the new password? victim: by the way, the unlocker you sent the second time works. gang: please try this password: [redacted] victim: thank you victim: and proof of deletion? gang: log.rar 3.45 mb gang: our apologies for delay. the archive pass is: [redacted] gang: initial access to your network was purchased on the dark web. then kerberoasting was carried out and we got passwords hashes. then we just bruted these and got domain admin password. spending weeks inside of your network we've managed to detect some fails we highly recommend to eliminate: 1. none of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious links or download any files, much less run them on their computer. 2. use strong passwords, change them as often as possible 1-2 times per month at least . passwords should not match or be repeated on different resources. 3. install 2fa wherever possible. 4. use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less vulnerable to attacks. 5. update all software versions. 6. use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools. 7. create a jump host for your vpn. use unique credentials on it that differ from domain one. 8. use backup software with cloud storage which supports a token key. 9. instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety precautions. the most vulnerable point is the human factor and the irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. we guarantee that we will not sell or publish your data, keep this conversation private, and delete this chat later. we won't come back for more money after payment and we won't attack you again. we wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future. thank you for working with us and your careful attitude to your security. victim: thank you, must say the breach report looks quite generic and not specific to us. victim: also the root password you provided earlier didn't work. gang: try this one [redacted]",4,0.2,hostile

any help is highly appreciated. thanks victim: hi. i was unable to access the chat for some time. it worries me. any problems? victim: hi. things are super difficult here. some of the others seem to have abandoned all hope. we have lost a lot of customers in the last year and we have had to downsize, we have fired colleagues. we own unsellable buildings. people are disillusioned, but i go on pushing and fighting. any help from you is appreciated. gang: hi. we've heard these stories many times. what do you offer? victim: sorry to hear this. this is not everyday for us. this is our first time. i do all i can to find solutions, so we can move on. honestly, it is not easy, both because of liquidity and ability. they don't understand the picture as clear as me. i try all i can to make them. i will get back to you. gang: we are waiting for your offer asap. victim: it sounds like you are frustrated that we cannot be more concrete. i am myself super frustrated. sometimes i feel my head is about to explode. victim: i do feel like we might be able to drive this in the right direction. i hear a lot of fears but you being professional as you are really helps them see there might be a way. i thank you for being patient with me, i need to keep the situation stable and i will do all i can. gang: will we see a counter offer from you today? victim: yes, i really hope that i can give it to you before thursday is over. there are movements in the right direction. gang: we are going to close the deal this week in any case. victim: look, i am doing everything i can but the company is in a very bad place. i am just trying to be honest with you and i am sorry that things are taking longer than both you and i would like. trust me i just want everything to fall in place quickly, shake hands with you and get on with trying to save the rubbles of a company. i am working my ass off and this feels threatening to me when you write like this, i really need you not to do this. gang: we are waiting for your offer today. victim: the last 24 hours have been absolutely rough. i almost didn t sleep last night, and when i finally fell asleep i got woken by my smallest child who was sick all over the place. victim: i am sorry if this is annoying for you and i guess you must hear a lot from people that they are in a bad place, but i just had to get that off my chest. i must try to find the strength to keep everyone in line here so we can find a way with you. victim: i am grateful for your patience, it is a very important and hard moment right now and they are hurting a lot because of a really bad year as well as other things. but i am on it and i will update you as soon as i can. gang: waiting for the update. victim: thanks. the company is in an crazy internal fight, people shout at each other, disagreeing on what to do. some think we should try to find a solution with you my team , some think that would be a dangerous mistake, potentially unlawfull and they want to try finding technical ways, and again some seem to have been giving up because they think the company was going down no matter what, due to really bad economy, closed projects and laid off people. they actually think this situation can be used for a restructuring process. no matter what i still believe that my team will get some of its way, but maybe in a very limited fashion. perhaps a group of us will have to work out something on our own. these are the discussions. it is fucked up, but i don't quit. i will get back. victim: quick update again: i have done a little progress, although it is not easy, but moving now. i am trying to come up with funds to offer. how would we transfer the money to you? it should be usd, right? gang: thank you for the update. we hope you will come to an agreement soon because we will not wait long. anyway restructuring you mentioned will be more expensive that a deal with us. we can help with the price and we can accept 200,000 this week. it is up to you to decide what way to choose. let us know your decision asap please. we need to move on. victim: i do hear that you want to move this on. i have been thinking to myself that you might also be in a situation where you need to show others progress. i think a lot about this and i am worried that i create expectations that i am not fully able to meet. at least not as quickly as i would like. i would rather be honest and realistic with you. victim: i am very grateful for you giving the new amount but i fear it is a mountain we are too small and weak to climb. victim: but do know this: i will do everything i can to try to get to a solution with you. i just need to be certain of what we can actually come up with for real. also we need to discretely exchange our local currency into usd. victim: can i ask how a deal would work? will you send us an invoice or how does it work with the payment? gang: we accept bitcoins. to gain bitcoins you have to go to any exchange platform as binance or coinbase. here are the guides: https: www.coinbase.com how-to-buy bitcoin https: www.binance.com en how-to-buy bitcoin you also can buy bitcoin from any local brokers. if you withdraw funds from your bank account, then you have to inform the bank that you need this money for investment purposes only. victim: oh, i understand. that is making it a whole lot more complicated, i have no experience with bit coins and that sort. are you sure we can get more than usd 5000 each day on those places? it looks like it might take a lot of time to even get approved on their site. victim: it has been very hard coming up with whatever little usd i might be able to offer you, also because i have had to keep the ghost of reconstruction away. i am almost ready to tell you what we can manage but i need to make sure that i look for even small additional amounts everywhere, as i fear that what we have is something that you will think is not very much. gang: so what do you have? let us know asap. victim: yes. stand by. thank you. victim: ok so i know you may think i am not serious-minded and quite annoying. i fear that you will take this the wrong way and i pray you will not be too offended. i am really doing all that i can. i have usd 71500. gang: we are not offended at all but your offer is not enough to close the deal unfortunately. we see you want a resolution a even made an offer that is not really bad. we want to come to an agreement with you and we suppose it is possible so we are ready to accept 170,000 and get this over with. i believe you and your colleagues are able to see that the agreement with us is more that possible. let us know asap. victim: i am very grateful for this and that you are trying to do what you can to make this work and i so much wish that we had all of that so we could end this today. i can feel you are really trying to help. but i am afraid we don t have it. i apologise to you. gang: you have to give us a renewed offer if you want this to end positively. victim: i do. i understand you need me to improve. i am trying, but it is super hard. gang: we believe you will cope with it. 170,000 is a price we can agree on with you. your colleagues should understand that. we are waiting for updates. victim: thank you, i understand. i am trying so hard to find alternatives. i know that you want this to move forward but we are deeply depleted and in big trouble already. gang: we will wait to hear about alternative you will find asap. victim: ok. thank you. victim: again i thank you for awaiting me. i must say that right now i feel lost. and desperate. i am doing all i can to better at least a little bit. but even my smallest steps are so heavy. this is so overwhelmingly scary and painful. victim: hello again and sorry for my late response. yet another absolutely awful night, i just want this nightmare to end. but let me give you an update so you know what is going on here: i am fighting on two fronts right now. getting approved to purchase btc in more than very small amounts is crazy hard because of regulations i think. i am looking at different options and will know more today, but it is complicated. and as you know, the company is in a sorry state and resources are so limited. right now the idea of being able to come up with more that i can offer you seems very black. but i understand i need to show you progress and i am doing all i can. gang: we get lots of payments from [redacted]. everything will be fine. victim: i really also hope everything will be fine. im still working on how to exchange, it is not easy. i am right now actively trying to better what we can come up with in terms of amount but i cannot promise anything right now. i will get back to you as soon as i can. victim: hi. i am out of alternatives. out of energy. out of help. i have spent everything i have raising the amount for you. i really hope you will accept it. i have usd 93.300. let us get this over with. gang: we appreciate your willingness to cooperate and you efforts of course but we are still far apart from each other. we will wait for better number on monday and we hope to finish the deal after we receive your renewed offer. victim: i was fearing you would say that. i simply don t know how i can put myself in a situation where i can find more. i don t know how. gang: do not give up. organize a meeting with you colleagues and try to find additional funds for this deal. victim: i have invested all my energy in meetings. i have had so many. big and small. and i have fought so hard to get to this. gang: waiting for positive new from you. victim: but what do you want me to do to get more? i am really trying my very best. finding a way to increase the amount is hell - let alone the nightmare it is to getting to the point where i can exchange it to bitcoin victim: i don t want to let everybody down. i need your help but i am not a magician. i m sorry. i don t know how to make it work the way you want, i wish i did. victim: i need to go for a late night ride, clear my head, try and see if i can translate my desperation into something. can i get in contact with you later tonight? gang: sure. my leadership decided to reduce the price to assist you with the process and we are ready to accept 125,000. i think this amount you can cope with and we can end all this. victim: i really appreciate that you help me like this, i really do. i pray that you and i can get things to a point where we will achieve what we have been working on. thank you for making my cases with them. victim: to try to make just some movement i went for a ride yesterday as you know. victim: i took a big chance and my neck is on the line for real here. i rode out to meet some very rough people to solve the bitcoins. i need this to work man. i pray to god i don t need to talk to them again. victim: but i have it in bitcoin for you now, we can end this now, i know it s not all you ask but i have it converted now. i have btc 1,562 ready i have screenshot for you. victim: wallet.png 96.5 kb gang: 100,000 and we have a deal here. victim: wait victim: i am desperately trying to get the last bit. what bitcoin-address should we send to? gang: this one [redacted]. victim: i have been fighting so hard for this. can we agree that 1 we transfer btc 1.7235 to your wallet [redacted] and 2 you will then send us the decryptors and provide full help with decryption, and 3 you will then send us a security report, and 4 you promise not to publish and or sell our data, and 5 you guarantee that you will not carry out any future attacks against us, and 6 we mutually agree to keep all of this a secret do you agree to this? gang: we agree. how soon are you able to transfer btc 1.7235? victim: we have an agreement, thank you. i have sent a test transfer to your wallet. can i ask you to please confirm that you have received it and the amount i have sent. thank you. gang: 0.00125 btc received. you can proceed with the rest. victim: i have now sent the rest. can i ask you to please confirm when they are received and then send the decryptors?

revil,chats,"victim: hello guys, i am the person in charge to negotiate with you on behalf of my client. the amount of xmr requested to my client to get the decryption tool, the files back available and not published in the dark web i have seen some exfiltrated data are published on your blog is huge and my client cannot afford to fully pay your claims. my client is trying to cope with this difficult situation, since it has been heavily struck by the current economic crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, with a dramatic fall of sales in the last months. my client s net revenues amount to eur 500.000,00 in the last financial statement 2.5 billion as gross revenues, which is a not relevant data if you guys are acquainted with economics . the financial situation of my client has been catastrophic since 2010, with a substantial decrease y y in net revenues and gross operating profits. the cyberattack you have carried out on my client s systems has blocked the company operation and all its internal operations have been shut down including deliveries, and as a consequence my client is not able to fulfil the market with its copper products and get revenues. my client has already had to make budget cuts and fire many of its employees or put them on unemployed insurance, with devastating effects on families and children amid the economic crisis due to covid19. therefore, it is impossible for my client to pay you 7.5 million usd. according to my client s financial condition, i think he might be considering paying a certain amount in order to protect his business and to obtain the decrypting tool for all the files very quickly. however, such amount would be lower than the one you have requested, due to the heavy financial situation. in my personal opinion, my client has the financial availability to pay you 500.000 usd very quickly. a greater amount would be very difficult almost impossible in my very personal opinion to be paid because of the current financial situation. let me know on this point. gang: hello. we have deals with many companies every day, our pricing policy takes into account the covid19 crisis. do not take cover by this, the price is affordable for the company. 500k from a company like your is not seriously, of course we can give you a discount that will depend on the quickness of your payment, but price can't be too low as you ask for. we hid the post from our blog for the talks. if we will have a deal this information will not be ever published. victim: what kind of discount are you guys thinking about? my client is really in a dire economic situation as previously said and i will try my best to convince him to add few money on the negotiation table. however adding money to his last offer would entail more budget cuts and firing more employees, leaving families without livelihood in this dramatic financial crisis. gang: you have no chances with 500,000 or this level of amounts of money, even don't try bluf by this. if you pay shortly, we accept 6,75m. if no, we start publication data part by part to speed up you. victim: we are not bluffing and you do not know the financial situation of my client. however i will get back to you as soon as my client gives me a feedback on your so called discount gang: https: www.sendspace.com file [redacted] gang: [redacted] consolidated financial report 310320.pdf gang: if you cant find your insurance manual. here is it. victim: oh well, so you guys are familiar with economics. are you sure you are able to read the numbers? my client has been losing money since 2010. in the consolidated financial report you exfiltrated you can see that in the first three months of 2020 only the financial loss amounts to eur [redacted] m. and take a look at the net financial position as at 31 march 2020 which is negative by eur [redacted] m. moreover, look at bond trading level 30 yield that my client needs to repay: [redacted]. the financial situation of my client is negative. i think you picked the wrong victim and the financial analysis you have performed prior to undertaking the hacking operations is absolutely wrong. look at the chart herein attached and maybe you will be able to understand that economics is not hacking and my client is not grubman nor travelex nor [redacted] the latter, just to remain in the [redacted] boundaries and a victim you may know . with regard to the insurance manual you guys have exfiltrated please note that the insurance company chubb does not cover the expenses related to a ransom payment but only the expenses my client is is facing for business interruption and recovery. this being said, my client needs to resume normal operations as soon as possible minimising financial losses due to inactivity caused by your actions. so we need to find a trade-off between your requests and my client s capability to pay. too much money requested and really my client does not have that financial capability. my client understands your position and aspirations but can t reach that amount. overnight i convinced my client to add more money on the table. his offer now amounts to 750.000,00 but this will entail more sacrifices in terms of employment and debt repayment. people will be fired amid this financial crisis but i guess you guys don t care about people left without livelihood. if you guys don t accept it, my client will set up the new infrastructure without data. it won t be easy but my client is pretty sure to go back on the business within a few weeks. i mean my client is making the argument that the cost to restart the new infrastructure without data will not be higher than 700-800 k usd. that amount represents the break-event point for my client. if my client pays a dollar more, it won t be convenient for him. so accept these 750 k usd or set a new affordable price or get nothing. if you accept or if you set a price which my client is able to meet, he will start the payment process as soon as possible, after finding a trusted exchange. please stop the countdown as usual during the negotiations with your hacking group. gang: good morning. sorry, but your offer still isnt interesting for us. companies with revenue like 10kk usually pays us this value. comeback later when you will be able to pay more. we can wait but your client doesnt have enough time. gang: if you think its easy to restore for 800k - go and do it. we dont care. first dump will be full of your client net passwords, [redacted] email dump, phone and password that he use in many other services than your network . next will be with clients info, ndas, payment infromation and technical specification of your production victim: do you mean if we do not strike a deal in 1 day 8 hours and 41 minutes you will double the price requested? gang: sure not gang: i added you 7 days. victim: ok guys. what i am trying to let you understand is that my client is not in a good financial position and the financial statement you have had to chance to read clearly testifies what i am saying. the production plants are on hold and people are put on unemployed insurances and are being fired. i know that you guys don t care because your goal is your personal profit. you carried out a perfect and clean job on my client s network i have been told and you clearly deserve to be rewarded for your work. the issue is not if my client is willing to pay but how much money my client can afford to pay without worsening his financial condition and safeguarding jobs and families. gangs. gang: yes. we buy it. somebody of your clients employee was infected but not by us. gang: that's why i said to you that your client need to use 2fa on citrix server. victim: thanks. since you guys have been so available to answer my question, can you please tell me which is the account whose credentials you have purchased? it is very important for my client to ascertain responsibilities of the security incident gang: sorry. i cant give you that information. victim: hello guys, sorry to bother you. but since the chat is still open i need one more info from you. it's very important for my client to get the full file tree and the list of the files you have exfiltrated, as well as the logs of the delete operations of such files. can you help me?

we got access to your network, encrypted the data there and downloaded it, i see no point in this question, we always do this, these are our methods, did you see our blog? you have two options to get the files: after payment or publicly on the blog. victim: looking for some sort of a file list if you have of our files. because otherwise the boss is waiting for it to finish investigation and this will take long time. i want to do this faster. can you send a list of the files?

all this will do is prove that you are indeed in a position of power, and i will be able to convince my boss that we need to speak about payment. i am trying to help you and me. so work with me, or ask your boss to put someone else to work with me. and i also ask that you stop threatening me, your team already do the damage, so now we can speak and reach agreement or you can play games of threats and verbal abuse. let's pretend we are adults ok? gang: my reaction is the result of your work. i don't see before me people who value their business, i see attempts to study the possibility of mitigation of the attack. we really keep our promises, there is no need to doubt it. we give the decryptor, we give references to the stolen files, we publish the files in case of a deal failure. and now we can imagine that we are adults and can discuss the deal. gang: understand one thing and bring it to your boss, decryptor and confidentiality is need not for us, but for you. do not scare us without paying, there are dozens of you, it is better to concentrate on your problem. gang: if my boss intervenes in this dialog, then it will not be communication, but two words and a timer per day, you are still lucky to deal with me, because i have time to answer you. gang: i am not going to enter into long correspondence and polemics anymore. you know the terms and conditions and they will remain unchanged. gang: 1. we fix the amount of the transaction after the final value is approved. 2. you pay the ransom in moneon or bitcoin. 3. after payment you get a universal decryptor for all infected computers. 4. you get a set of links that contain your files. 5. after downloading your files are deleted from our servers without the possibility of recovery. 6. no one but us will know about this incident. gang: you can read about travalex, a very instructive story. they had the opportunity to prevent it, as a result, this error became inexcusably expensive for them. victim: i read about you in media and bleeping computer. i have no doubt you will follow through and while my boss will make the business decision, i am trying to follow his instructions and work with you. i am asking you to work with me and give me what my boss is asking for. let me further explain, our systems are almost back-up, but i am trying to reach common ground. can you share the list of files you take? my boss does not care about publicity, but he does care about protecting people, if you can demonstrate what data you take, even just file list, it will go a long way in the discussion here. i am not trying to waste your time or mine, this will help no one. i know you are big group and you attack many companies and that we are just a number. i also understand you have the power. i am trying to be honest and explain to you what will help me here, this is the process i need to follow. so the question is whether it is possible for you to give me list of files or no. if no, i will tell my boss and we can figure out next steps. but let s try to work together. gang: at this stage of negotiations - my answer is no. the situation may change if we find a compromise and reach an agreement. i do the same as you and follow the instructions of my boss. tonight he will get acquainted with the dialogue and if there are new instructions, you will learn about it. gang: and i work with you, at your request was given 4 days, as well as enabled mode of bitcoins to accelerate the process of receiving funds. this is done first of all for you so that you can recover your systems faster and get back to work. victim: at this stage of negotiations - we cannot proceed unless you provide us with the list of files and 2-3 random sample files you took. if you break negotiations at this point, you are going to publish the data anyways, so there is zero difference between giving us the information or publishing. the only key difference is that if you publish instead of giving us the information we need, there will be zero chance of further negotiations. i hope your boss reconsiders his position so that we can finally move forward. gang: ok, but in return i reduce the timer for decision making. gang: http: dnpscnbaix6nkwvystl3yxglz7nteicqrou3t75tpcc5532cztc46qyd.onion posts [redacted]?s [redacted] gang: this link is not yet visible to anyone except you. victim: first, thank you for finally providing this information which will allow me to work with the boss. second, i will certainly push to make a decision as fast as possible. however - reducing the timer will not work. actually because you delay the analysis for no real reason we will need more time. given the amount it will not happen before friday. you can try and push and you are doing a great job of that, but in a company that needs to follow process, it will not work and all you will do is end up losing this opportunity to close the issue for both side. please increase the timer as we are asking. i am trying to work with you. gang: we gave you enough time to make a decision. if your boss doesn't want to pay 6kk but wants to get off with a smaller amount, let him hurry. victim: we can argue together and you can argue you gave us enough time. in a company that is publicly listed, 3 days is not enough time. so let's stop with the games here, we are trying to work with you and i have no interest to play games, i tell you what i need not because i feel like it for fun and giggles. it is also not my money, so all threats mean nothing. i am speaking to you because of genuine interest to solve the problem and make sure we conclude this successfully. if you run the timer and publish the conversation is over. i know you do not care either but i am sure we are both interested in getting this to successfully conclude. you took the first step in showing me what i needed, now do whatever you need, but i am telling you that your new deadline is not going to happen. your call how we do this. gang: companies that are traded on stock exchanges, solve the problem in 12 hours, i say this because i know. i see that your actions are only aimed at delaying the solution of this incident. gang: 4 days ago you have asked for additional time to buy xmr, at now you write like you only now start consider payment process. who play games? you already had plenty of time to make a decision and consider different options. now your task is to go to the boss and come to me with the answer. the timer will not be moved until i get information about the deal. victim: you decision, your rules. i will pass on your message certainly. victim: and just so you know... carribean rules because of usd embargo during covid, maybe do some research on this. either way, you are not changing your position, i understand. please understand that when timer expires if you publish this conversation is over and second, there will not even be a negotiation on price until the boss does his analysis. thank you and have a wonderful day. gang: think not about the fact that we will not make a profit, think about the problems that will arise after publication. have a good day, too. victim: understood. it is a 2-way street my friend. we either try to work together or you already decide to publish etc. that is why i asked for the data so that i can prove to the boss that it is a serious situation. but it took you time, now i need the time to work on the boss. gang: i do not need to be persuaded, go to the boss and come back with an answer, you have little time left. gang: you will have another day after the publication sees the world. for now there will be no link to downloads.",6,-0.3,hostile

revil,chats,"victim: hello, i have read your site and i have informed my boss. he asked if we can pay you 8000 euro to your bank account to be able to take our files back but how can we be sure you will help us? gang: hello.you offer is very small.not interested. victim: we have lost about 41 days of data since our last backup in some of our systems. some systems have been fully recovered so we can start working but it will take us more than 2 weeks to do manual work for adding thing to our system. my boss told me to figure out a way to make a deal with you so we can pay you. that way you can help us recover the lost days faster instead of manual work. please help us recover our data faster. i now work with my technician to see the faster way to start working, so an option to work with you would be best if it is faster. gang: your offer looks ridiculous.make a really interesting offer to my boss. victim: why you say ridiculous sir? i am trying to find a way to make this work for both sides so it has some value to us. it would be great if you have the solution and we can get our files faster because my technician now wants to format computers and start from our latest offline backup to set things up clean. gang: then ask your technician if they can help you with personal data leaks. also, in case of non-payment, your information will be published in our blog and disseminated in the media. victim: can we find a way to recover our files faster than our technician can recover them? our technician said that we need 2-3 weeks of manual work for formatting, setting up and manual input to get most of our systems back to work. this is a long time and it involves some costs from our side. how much time your service will take to recover our systems back to normal and what is the process? our technician works hard in the last two days but his process is very slow and we will have to involve some people for manual work. this is time consuming. i want to understand if your service is faster first of all. gang: everything happens automatically after payment. victim: so you mean that within one day we will have all files restored and all systems running as they were before the problem? gang: yes , all right. victim: that is a good option because if we are able to move faster with your service this will have important impact in our office. now regarding payment, do you believe that we can work together to find a viable solution to the cost so we can select your service instead of manual work that will take us a long time? gang: make a really interesting offer to my boss. and we can work. victim: the problem is that at this time the covid situation in our country has severely impacted all the business. greece is under a heavy financial crisis for over 10 years and our office is closed due to government lockdown. cashflows are probably the worse in years. due to crisis we all work remotely and this year probably will be the worst in decade. so cashflows are really limited. can we agree on 12000euro paid in your bank account so you can help us? gang: first, we do not accept payments to a bank account. secondly, our boss is unhappy with your proposal. victim: can we please find a solution to this payment? i want to express that since your solution is faster than our technician we want to work with the faster solution but it should be an amount that we can pay fast and get our files. our technician said that he needs only time to get us up and working along with manual work. but time is important here for my boss. please discuss with your boss to settle to an amount that we can pay. please consider that we need also time to see how your payment will be done, so as the time passes your services will not add any value. we want to work with you to purchase your professional services to help us recover faster than our technician. gang: my boss is ready to give you a 20 discount on fast payment. victim: thank you, in that case we are ready to pay 12000 - 20 9600euro. we will have the money in 3 days. we appreciate it. let us know how you want us to do the payment. gang: friends, you apparently did not understand, we are ready to provide you with a 20 discount from the original price. gang: 170000-20 136000 victim: how we are supposed to find this money? our offices our closed and during covid this money is not something that can be found. could we please discuss a realistic amount? gang: make a really interesting offer to my boss. 12k euro its small offer. victim: can you please adjust your offer to greece so we can pay you and get our files faster? the money you ask is unfortunately far more than my boss capabilities. 12.000 seems little for you? the average salary here in greece is 500euro per month. please sir lets discuss an offer that can be paid fast. if we need 10 months to find the money you request there is no use for the files. right now we need to recover faster. please talk to your boss. we can find the money i suggested in 3 days and send it to you if you agree gang: your offer is too small to be considered.make a really interesting offer to my boss. victim: tomorrow my technician will have a clear view of the main systems that are up and running so we can estimate and focus on the things we are missing from backups. he said that most systems are in place from our cloud provider, so i will be back to you if we need your help with your services. i thought that we could have your help on this so we can use your service to launch faster but our technician said we should wait for his results recovering from cloud and then see if anything missing so we can focus on that. gang: if you do not pay, your files will be published on the blog and transferred to the media, the rest of the data will be sold. in any case, it will affect your reputation, think about your clients, fines and other troubles that await you. we you a solution to avoid all of this. victim: sir, we just need to save time restoring our files. if you have a solution to this let me know if we can work together. i just want to save time to launch faster. this is our focus her.e. but i believe this will take also time because you cannot understand that time is important here. if we could have the files yesterday it would make a great deal for the office. we are losing more than 1000euro every day we delay. gang: wait for answer. victim: ok gang: everything my boss has to offer 136k. victim: you are still referring to thousands of dollars sir? gang: yes, all right. victim: i told you that our office is in greece and if you read the news we are closed by lockdown and it was the worst year for any office here in greece so such an amount unfortunately is not something that is feasible. so please consider if you can really help us work with you in some way. we have about 2 days until weekend to decide because new equipment has been ordered to set everything from scratch. hopefully the most important system from our operation is up and running today. we are missing a lot of data still and in 1 2 days we will have a total estimation of losses that require manual work. thank you for communication. gang: this is my boss's last sentence. victim: in 1-2 days we will have a meeting with our outsourced technician to check everything that is missing. all depends from the cost. estimation of lost data. still your cost is far too high to be able to pay. i still tell you that we are willing to keep our options open and your service of instant full recovery is still an option for us. but we need to work a lot on the price to be able to see it as an option. gang: your price is still too low for this amount of work. victim: unfortunately our estimation was wrong. we had a briefing from our technician right now. there is a lot more work to be done, not only 1-2 weeks to do manual work. probably we will need more than 30 days. our technician said that the attack was well planned and we estimate lots of effort to recover from manual work. also we will have to delay a lot because of the malware is still inside. so we will have to replace software and probably hardware until it is fully cleaned. let me know, if we work with your solution, the malware will be gone from our network ? gang: yes of course. victim: our technican asks how you did the attack, through remote desktop or mail? gang: after payment we will conduct an audit for you. victim: ok that is an added value. an audit would cost about 5000-10000euro. so you will decrypt files, our systems will be up and running in 1 day, our systems will not contain malware and also you would conduct an audit. correct? gang: audit means we will tell you how we infected your network.for your large network, this will cost a lot more. victim: how much this would cost? now i am helping my boss estimate the overall help of your service. victim: greek companies for our audit gave us an offer between 5000-10000 euro. don't forget that in greece such services are much cheaper than us. victim: according to my boss we are ready to pay much bigger amount to get at least some of your services. but we would like to ask you a very serious discount to your valuable services in order to reach a deal. we understand that you are trying to extract as much money as you can from this deal, but the amount you demand right now is not something we can discuss. we want to work with you and we can find more money. try once more to discuss with your boss. if we reach a deal of around 45.000euro we will manage to find the amount in some days. and we can send it to you in some installments. gang: 1-we will check how we got into your system. 2-get the whole network decoder. 3-all sensitive data will be deleted from our servers. 4-let's clean your network of our virus. 5-you will restore your system in one day. 6-neither reputation nor customers will suffer. it all depends only on your actions. we have been the administrators of your network for a long time and we know that you can pay 500k. we have made a huge discount and look forward to serious offers from you. victim: ideally we would like from you the following: 1. get the last data from one virtual machine to save lots of manual work 2. stop your attacks to our network so we can do business because we lose more than 1000euro day as we delay. can we agree on 55.000 so we can end this before weekend? we will show some good will to send you some money as soon as we can. gang: wait for answer. victim: also we have serious problem with monero. please check if you can give us bitcoin wallet as our accountant said that we have problem with monero. gang: yes of course. victim: lets work on the price. so if you accept on 55k we can find the money and we will use bitcoin to send you asap. now our accountant tries to work with the cryptocurrency thing. victim: if we send you bitcoin how much time it takes for you to receive it and send us the solution? gang: 30 minute gang: but we cant accept 55k victim: please sir give us a price we can pay today because the price you requested will take lots of time. give us your best shot so we can move the process today gang: wait for answer. victim: please try to match what we have so we can find the funds easily and move faster because time is important for us so that we don't have to setup all the network again from scratch. lets try to match the price of the current offer because we have these funds available now, so if its close to that we might be able to find the funds today. our accountant said that it will take days to find a lot of extra money because it is a matter of cash flow, exchanges, banks and stuff that we don't understand. gang: ok, we take you the last step to meet 100k. gang: price update refresh the page. victim: the price of 100k is about 85k euro. it is a price that i think we can meet. i want to talk with our accountant to check how fast we can find this amount and start the process to find bitcoin gang: okay we wait victim: just to repeat our deal. once you receive the requested amount: 1. you will stop any bad actions to our network 2. you will provide decryptor that will decrypt all computers in our network 3. you will help us if we have technical problems 4. you will stop any other bad actions regarding our office 5. you will provide security audit for our office correct? gang: yes , all right. victim: our accountant has some serious problems with transferring the money on time. can you please extend the time so we can be able to pay the greed amount in bitcoin? gang: how much time do you need ? victim: it might be from today until wednesday for the processing to be done since we our accountant has never done it before. he thinks he can get all the amount we have agreed but he is missing some for now and probably it can be found during the day. and then he needs to transfer the funds so that the processing to bitcoin happens. so i think until wednesday thursday or maybe much earlier if all is done today. gang: okay we give until wednesday. victim: thank you. expect update from our side. victim: can you please update the timer? gang: okay. victim: we will do test payment first to see if you receive it ok? will it show in your system automatically? gang: no problem. gang: yes gang: wait for 3 confirmations by bitcoin system, it takes 30 min gang: to use a decryptor run it as administrator and turn off antivirus before. you can use a decryptor as gui application or through cmd. cmd commands: universaldecryptor.exe -full universaldecryptor.exe -path c: folder universaldecryptor.exe -file c: folder file.txt.random ext decryptor with -full option will decrypt all with default params. if you use it as gui application, mi recommend you choose create backups option. if you use decryptor without this option, you should not interrupt decryption process, otherwise some files will be irreversibly damaged. gang: 1. backup provided there is no direct access to copies from local machines 2. it is important to regularly evaluate which employees have access and permission to which resources. most employees do not need a high level of domain access. 3. use professional e-mail and web security tools that can analyze the content of websites, email attachments, and files for malware. 4. keep your operating system, software and all devices updated on an ongoing basis. 5. antivirus software, ips intrusion prevention systems and corporate email protection have been updated to the latest version. 6. divide your network into specific security zones so that malware caught in one zone cannot spread to others. 7. security training courses to teach employees not to download files, open email attachments, or follow unknown links in messages. gang: your network was accessed through your vpn. gang: all your data was automatically deleted after receiving payment. our presence on your network will soon be terminated. victim: how long have you been in our network?",3,-0.55,pragmatic

we might be able to get a few more thousand dollars but definitely not 355k. i think the most we can actually send you is 284,811.29. this is what we wired to the broker and he can purchase the crypto. his own fee is included in that amount but i think i can ask him to hold off on charging that so the full amount is yours okay?

we don't have another 30k. some of us are going to max our credit card to get near the 300k you're asking. we really can't make another 30k happen and the broker in the us said its illegal to pay in monero, this is why it must be bticoins please gang: there is nothing we can do to help. our latest offer is 300k. if not, we will simply publish your details. we made maximum concessions victim: come on mate please help me out, we came this far. the broker said majority of the time you waive the 10 . i don't want to waste anymore of your time on this with me, let's just be done. i can't get any more money gang: not interested. victim: you're going to turn us away over 10 ? what is this even for? gang: after 12 hours, the amount will return to 1kk victim: i need to know why you add the 10 , i can't just ask someone for 30k with no explanation gang: i repeat bitcoin transactions are tracked and the payment gateway takes a commission to clear them victim: they charge you 10 when you try to clear it ? or is it a small and you are adding more? can we agree on 3 ? gang: no victim: you're killing me!! gang: our agreement 300k will not be lower victim: we agree with 300k, but youre trying to add another 30k and we don't have any way to make that happen. we can only send you exactly 300k in bitcoin, you won't get less than this! gang: then pay in monero 300k victim: it's illegal! gang: these are not our problems gang: if you need decryptor pay. victim: why do you ask for payment in a currency the us can't pay ? gang: if you keep asking stupid questions, you will be banned from this chat. either you pay, or we publish your data in the media with the subsequent sale, you must pass this information to your boss. victim: he understands, we're trying to figure it out. there's no way to make the 10 lower?? also he wants to know if you will let us download all the files you took from us after payment gang: we provide a complete file tree for complete confidentiality after payment arrives at our account, the data is automatically deleted along with the server. victim: okay we 100 would like the file tree before you delete the files. but if there is any way we can download the files before you delete them, that would be preffered. is that possible at all? gang: no, this violates our privacy policy. gang: only file tree victim: okay thank you. some people are just getting online now, so i will let you know soon on the payment gang: okay victim: can you lock the amount to be 6.0027 btc so we can purchase the right amount without having to go back to our vendor multiple times? gang: ok victim: sorry our us broker hasn't been responsive, but i think that is because of the time zone. can we still pay you in a few hours when they are online? i did not expect this to happen, but wanted to let you know that everything is set, i am just waiting on them gang: no problem victim: thank you very much! i appreciate your help. victim: we have paid gang: okay wait 3 confirmations victim: please send us universal decryptor now that there are 3 confirms. thank you gang: to use a decryptor run it as administrator and turn off antivirus before. you can use a decryptor as gui application or through cmd. cmd commands: universaldecryptor.exe -full universaldecryptor.exe -path c: folder universaldecryptor.exe -file c: folder file.txt.random ext decryptor with -full option will decrypt all with default params. if you use it as gui application, mi recommend you choose create backups option. if you use decryptor without this option, you should not interrupt decryption process, otherwise some files will be irreversibly damaged. victim: thank you, please send us the file tree as well?

revil,chats,"gang: hello, we are revil group. we want to inform that your company local network have been hacked and encrypted. we have all your local network data. the price to unlock is 5.500,000. now we're keeping it a secret, but if you do not reply us within 3 days it will be posted on our news-site. think about the financial damage to your stock price from this publication. in case of successful negotiations we guarantee that you will get decryptors for all your machines, non recoverable removal of downloaded data and security report on how you were hacked to fix your vulnerabilities. we hope that you can correctly assess the risks for your company. you can find more information about revil group in google. posting on our blog and further publications in the media will lead to significant losses for your company: court and government fines, data recovery, loss of reputation, abandonment of clients, drop in limits. but don't panic! we are in business, not in war. we can unblock your data and keep everything secret. all we need is a ransom. in this case, you also get: a security report, a complete tree of compromised data files, permanently deleting downloaded data, support with tips on unlocking and protecting. victim: i'm a little confused. your message says 3 days but your website says 19 hours. your decryption tool doesn't do us any good since we are in the process of recovering, but you may interest us with the data that you say you have taken. can you show us what you took? gang: you were too slow when trying to assess the damage and did not write to us gang: of course wait for answer victim: will we have this today? please increase the timer, there's no way we can make any payment in only 14 hrs gang: 3 day added gang: yes we prepaid proof of hack victim: okay please send the proof of what you took from our network gang: ok gang: https: privatlab.com s v [redacted] pass for download : [redacted] pass for archive : [redacted] https: privatlab.com s d [redacted] delete",1,-0.38,cold threat
revil,chats,"victim: in the ransom note, you stated that you took 500 gb of information, can you provide us examples of this information gang: hello. if you are satisfied with the screenshots of the folders, we will provide them to you within a few minutes. or we can provide you with a link to some of your data for review. but it will take about an hour. victim: we will take both gang: good. 10 minutes and we will provide you with screenshots. victim: thank you. we will wait for file samples as well gang: ok gang: we would like to draw your attention to the fact that we did not delete data from your esxi servers. the information is also encrypted there. if we make a deal, we will give you a decryptor so that you can restore the servers. gang: but we do not guarantee recovery if you carry out any manipulations with these servers. victim: understood gang: good. this also applies to other files outside of esxi. victim: please send the sample files when ready gang: we have started transferring some of the data to the new server so that you can familiarize yourself with the data. it will take some time. in 5 minutes you will be able to get acquainted with what we have already transferred for you. gang: we will upload files here for review. the link is available through the tor browser. some of the data is still in the process of being copied. victim: thank you gang: we've finished copying the sample data for you. can you please tell me, are you only interested in data files or are you also interested in the decryptor? as we already wrote before, we strongly discourage using third-party solutions. victim: 3rd party solutions? is there different pricing for breaking it apart? gang: 3rd party solutions - various programs, the descriptions of which say that they can recover data, but this is not the case. typically, the use of such third-party programs leads to the fact that our decryptor can no longer recover your data. gang: if you are ready to move on to the deal in the near future, then we can provide you with a discount. if you do not need a decryptor, then the discount will be slightly higher. victim: i understand now on the 3rd party solutions. thank you victim: thank you for providing the details. i am discussing with the board gang: good. we will be in touch. victim: our board is having issues with the quantifying the 500 gb that has been taken. to help them out, is there a certain ip or something i can hunt for to quantify this on the exfil side. based on this, then the board should be in a position to discuss options. gang: do i understand correctly that you do not need a decryptor? victim: that is incorrect. we are still understanding the damage caused to the organization. gang: this is just business, it makes no sense for us to lie or not fulfill obligations. if we do business this way, there will be no profit for us. in fact, you question is very strange - we think that the provided data is already enough to understand the seriousness of your problem. it's all about your reputation and possible damage to your customers. we have been in your network for more than 2 weeks and we think you understand that there was enough time to download even more information. you can also read about revil on the internet and find out that 500 gigabytes is a small leak, since sometimes several terabytes of data are downloaded. and also you will find out that if we can't reach the agreemnt, then we will have to publish some of the data in our blog. you should also know that in 5 days the amount will be doubled. victim: thank you for this as providing this explanation victim: we have performed the research that you requested. in addition, we have studied ransom payments from various third party sources. the board is asking for you to consider 800k for the package to gain consensus. can we agree to this amount? gang: do you want us to give you a discount of more than 90 ? of course this is impossible. i will give you a small example. the company is close to your profile, the annual turnover was 2.5 times less, as well as we had 2 times less data and we have already published some of the data in the blog - as a result, this company paid 4 million. they also did not need a decryptor - they were able to recover from the backups that we missed. next comes simple math. what you read is either small companies or information with understated amounts. most companies do not advertise the fact of hacking and payment. gang: apparently you do not realize the seriousness of the situation and the consequences. loss of reputation loss of clients and possible litigation with them. financial losses due to downtime that can take a very long time. your data will also be seen by your competitors the stocks in the market will begin to fall, and this is clearly not to your investors' liking. and much more. you are a big, serious company - be realistic. gang: if you are ready to seriously discuss the deal in the near future, then we will be ready to slightly reduce the amount. if your new proposal is again frivolous, we will have to prepare a blog post with the first part of the data. victim: we want to seriously discuss this and as you said, this is a business deal so please give me something to work with and i will discuss with the board and come back to you. victim: if we work together i am sure we can gain consensus victim: here is one article as part of our research https: www.tripwire.com state-of-security security-data-protection increase-in-ransomware-demand-amounts-driven-by-ryuk-sodinokibi victim: again we want to gain consensus gang: i recommend that you do not trust such reports. we don't know what information the coveware report was based on. how many companies are using coveware? what is the size of the company and what is their revenue? was there a data leak? or was the company able to recover on its own and the company was interested only in non-disclosure? company profiles? and much more. we also recommend that you be extremely careful when contacting a company like coveware. as practice shows, the task of such companies is to make money on the client's problem. most often they use payment per hour. therefore, they usually start to play for time during negotiations and thereby pull money from the client. they won't care about your data. and if the deal does not take place, then the data is published and companies like coveware will do it anyway for this fact - they will still make money. they are often too confident that we will agree to any amount and will not publish the data, but you can take a look at our blog and see how many companies they faked in this way. it is also a frequent case when we publish the first part of the data - companies immediately go to the deal, understanding how serious everything is. returning to the topic of statistics of payments and amounts - as you understand, the companies that ignite do not want publicity, so you rarely see news that the company paid 5-10-15-20 million. but this happens. here is a public example for you, to which we have nothing to do, but i think the meaning will be clear: https: www.wired.com story garmin-ransomware-hack-warning this is a public event. the company did not want to pay, after which part of its data was published and as far as i know - after that the company quickly agreed to the deal. i could provide private evidence of other multi-million dollar deals, but of course i won't. we do business with integrity. all the more would you like it if in the future we would tell other companies about your case? if we come to a deal, no one will know about it, otherwise you will be another example for our other companies. as for the amount. i think you perfectly understand that you will incur large financial losses. you are already losing money and i don t think you want it to continue like this. and now we are only talking about easy to work with. but do you understand that there will be other losses? clients will find out about what happened to you and find out that their data has been published, including confidential. including problems with their projects. i think it is not easy for them not to want to continue working with you, and they will also sue you. and probably it will also go about millions of claims. so what happens if competitors take advantage of the data we can publish? how will investors react to this? believe me, there is enough data for the company to incur more serious losses and they will exceed the amount requested from us. we are not the first day in this business and we can conditionally calculate how much the company can and will be willing to pay. as well as possible losses of the company. therefore, we offer an adequate amount and it does not include the discount that we can offer if the company conducts a correct and serious conversation, and is also ready to conduct a deal up to double the amount and publish the first part of the data. we are still waiting for a serious offer from you. keep in mind that tomorrow we will be preparing the first publication for our blog regarding your company - we are going to publish it on friday if we do not come to an agreement. the blog is followed by many media and as soon as a new entry appears there, after a few hours it appears on many news portals. gang: a link to our blog where you can check out the leaks of other companies that didn t make the deal: http: dnpscnbaix6nkwvystl3yxglz7nteicqrou3t75tpcc5532cztc46qyd.onion i also recommend that you familiarize yourself with this material in order to avoid mistakes: http: dnpscnbaix6nkwvystl3yxglz7nteicqrou3t75tpcc5532cztc46qyd.onion posts [redacted] victim: thank you for providing this and i will discuss with the board victim: as we are chatting in good faith, we would like to keep our conversations private. can we setup a private chat as others might be viewing our conversation victim: the ransom note was uploaded to vt; therefore, i am concerned someone could download and monitor. i am authorized to negotiate for the company. victim: [redacted] gmail.com gang: we will not be able to link the gmail account with the your company. linkedin account or facebook of an employee or company? phone call? after you provide us with a contact for communication, we will remove it from our correspondence so that no one can see it gang: we removed from the chat all the message where the name of your company was mentioned, as well as screenshots of the data, by which it was possible to determine which company could be discussed. we are waiting for your contact information to switch to another chat. victim: i am stepping into a board meeting and will get the information you desire for verification. victim: the phone will not work as those are down due to your encryptor gang: okay. let us carry out verification via facebook or linkedin. gang: we can provide you with a new private chat without verification, but if we are confused by the correspondence in it, we will return to the main chat, where we are currently communicating. gang: let me know as soon as you are ready to receive a password and instructions. after that, write to us in a new chat and we will remove the password and instructions from the main chat. victim: here is our proposal to link to the gmail account. we noticed that you used the [redacted] account to pivot in the network. is this verification enough to send this to the gmail account gang: yes, that will be enough. gang: did you receive instructions and password? victim: yes... victim: i entered in the password victim: please destroy the other chat support victim: and we will do our conversation here victim: please confirm when complete gang: why do we need this? we have removed all information that could help someone identify your company name. victim: the proofs are still in the chat window victim: apologies for the extra steps as we gain consensus gang: write to me where the evidence is left and i will delete it. gang: i see screenshots. i removed them. victim: kill the onion link victim: to the directory gang: ready victim: thank you gang: i think we can start discussing the deal. victim: the board is still reviewing the information you provided and contemplating an offer back gang: good. we are in touch. gang: how are things going into the negotiation of the deal? your time is coming to an end. if by tomorrow we do not agree on a deal, we will publish the first post on our blog. and also discounts will cease to be relevant. and we will already be discussing the next discount from the doubled amount, and as you understand, the amount in the end will be more than 9 million. victim: you ask for a lot in a short period as many people are discussing options. being your advocate and to gain consensus, you should realize that this takes time and to post early does not help this business deal. as the board is considering options, do you have a new number so i can take to them board. gang: we all perfectly understand, but there are certain algorithms and deadlines in our work, which have proven their effectiveness more than once. gang: as the board is considering options, do you have a new number so i can take to them board. - what number are we talking about? victim: the amount for the package. you ask for 9m. i trust to gain consensus the discounts to which you speak of can be factored in gang: if in the near future we come to an agreement, then i think we will be able to provide a discount of 10-15 . gang: but we will discuss the discount specifically when we receive an offer from the company. we do not recommend offering understated amounts - you must be realistic. otherwise, as practice shows, negotiations are delayed, which leads to publications and an increase in the amount. victim: as your advocate, i understand your position. a few questions from the board 1 the data you have taken - how do we receive it back 2 do you explain how you took the data and got into our company 3 do you provide that you will not attack us again 4 what assurance do we receive that the data does not leak in 6 months from now how do we know that you destroyed it victim: 5 what if the decryption key does not work - do you provide some type of support gang: 1 you can recover this data using the decryptor anyway. but if required, we will provide you with a link to all your data. 2 yes, we will provide you with information on how we got into the company's network and how we got access to all the data. 3 we don't do that kind of thing. this will ruin our reputation. we will give you recommendations on how to avoid repeated intrusion from other teams . 4 why will we not save them - why waste resources on this? as soon as we receive payment, we will delete the data from all backup servers and it will remain on only one server so that you can download it if you need it. then we will remove them from there. this is a business. if we leak, we will ruin our reputation and other companies will not pay us. 5 our software is time-tested. this will not happen if you have not tried to restore data using third-party software. victim: thank you for this. i will provide to the board. i do not know what time zone you are in, but i suspect the board will provide me guidance in the am. i do not know if you take a rest in your business gang: good. we will be in touch.",8,0.1,hostile

he shared with me her internal conversations and her belief, like you and me, that a deal is better than any publication. however, she said, reviewing the information you sent will not convice the relevant people to pay that amount of many. it's about risk management she said. decryption keys and that information should cost around 1m. what would be your answer to her?

it's important that you will be completely honest with me, and if you don't know the answer, i would appreciate if you could check with the boss. are you still interfering with our systems? do you do any actions related to our employees? awaiting your answer, [redacted] gang: we provide this information only after payment along with the audit of your network. gang: i remind you once again that all our agreements are valid only in case of quick payment. it seems to us that you are deliberately delaying the dialogue. victim: sir, i wish i could have brought you into the trustees meeting. in the middle of meeting when they discuss paying your suggested price, came this notice of your continued efforts to sabotage the charity network. with all due respect, sir, do you think it was necessary? do you think it was helpful? i'm doing a tremendous effort to show everyone your nice, welcoming and human face, and you keep on your evil moves? how should i show my face now? i guess that you haven't understood that you and me are working together to bring this deal?

thanks, emilie. gang: your time runs exactly to the one indicated by me above. victim: ok, maybe i'm a bit confused. i trust you. good night sir. gang: okay. victim: good evening sir. i hope that you took some time off to be with your family. i'm here to answer any question. respectfully, [redacted]. victim: good evening sir. the it team have sent me a file, which they kindly ask you to decrypt in order to see, as mentioned in your early note and here on this website, the the decryption tool actually work. i will try to attach it now. respectfully, [redacted]. gang: hello victim: good morning sir, i could not sleep the whole night. thanks for the file, i'll be in touch later this morning. thanks, [redacted]. victim: this was written couple of hours ago, but apparently there was a fault in your system and it was sent just now. gang: okay , we wait. victim: thanks, i'm here. i would like to ask you, first, informally before i speak to my trustee in the board . is there any chance that you will be able to extend the deadline for wednesday evening? the reason i'm asking is because there was some government move to our senior leadership, and i'm afraid that they were asked not to pay. i can tell you that the majority of board members want to complete the deal, as it's the only way they can restore the system, but it seems that the weekend brought with it also pressure in the opposite direction. would love to hear your boss opinion on that. respectfully, [redacted] gang: we are not ready to stretch the time like that. all my boss is willing to offer is tuesday night, if payment is received by then. gang: if your senior management is unwilling to pay, we will start publishing information, be sure to remind them of this. victim: this is why i'm checking with you sir. the board of the charity is meeting in 1:30 hours, 2 pm gmt , and i want to bring them the most updated information from you. at the moment, you were kindly offering the charity to pay 1.5m and deadline is tonight. if i could get an extra stretch as you wrote to pay 1m, and deadline is wednesday morning, that would have been very helpful to get the board and trustees approval, despite any other external voices. please bring it to the boss approval. anything of this will make my mission more likely to succeed. thanks in advance, [redacted]. gang: we have already given you time to discuss these issues at your meeting today. my boss isn't ready to give you time until wednesday. victim: i understand. may i speak with the boss? can he come to the chat? can i give him an email address? gang: all conversations are conducted through this chat, and all messages are sent to it. we gave you a good discount and enough time to resolve internal issues. it's all. victim: please, you can't leave me with this answer. i see that boss can't do wednesday, and i understand his and your perspective. will it be possible to leave price as it is, and give time decision time until tuesday night? if it was not this external inputs, i'm confident that i could have sort it out by myself. thanks, [redacted] victim: please reply sir, i'll be back in an hour. need to go and prepare for board meeting. a women, you know. gang: our agreement is valid until monday night, i have nothing more to add for you. the discount is provided for quick payment. victim: i see, sir. i can't ask more, and i don't beg. if you can extend the deadline until tuesday - it will be helpful with the board in 5 minuets. if you are not interested - i will not be happy with it, as it will be more difficult for me to persuade board and trustees to complete the deal, but - i will understand. as said, i'm a woman who respects herself and her partners. i will not beg. respectfully, [redacted] gang: an article in our blog will be prepared tonight not published at the moment . perhaps this way your bosses will want to pay faster. gang: my boss is willing to allow until wednesday, but in this case, discounts are out of the question. victim: so sir, what are my option, currently??

let me explain to you something. there is no other way to decrypt files other then to purchase the decryption software. the attempts to use something different then original software may cause irreversible damage. your files will be unable to decrypt! victim: we perfectly understand you but, as told before, we have a significantly lower size than you have considered. your demands are far from feasible for us no such cash available . as i told you, we are not trying to negotiate but if we want to reach something feasible for both parties, we need to get close to realistic capabilities. are you open to discuss? gang: i offer you 2,500,000 and it's valid until the end of the weekend. victim: still high, but anyway i'll pass your offer to management. anyway, is there any proof of trust that the decryption software will fully solve the issue? victim: by the way, we don't have bitcoin. how shall we proceed? gang: to prove the decryption software works you may upload few encrypted files and a key related to them. it usually locates at c: .key. or at root of a shared folder gang: you may purchase bitcoin here - https: www.kraken.com just create a new business account and make sepa-payment. after registration and sepa-payment you should immediately contact to kraken support and raise the withdrawal limit to 2.5m per 1 btc transaction. victim: there are several files like this one gang: yes, and then upload encrypted files which contain 4igkanbkvldlbbkahplioso-[redacted] .[redacted] victim: ok ok, now i undertand victim: i will upload a single folder with different file types. is it ok? victim: my colleagues are warning me about some sort of verifications asked by kraken registration. i will be updating status. gang: upload few encrypted files with a key. you don't have to upload full folder. victim: there you go gang: i have uploaded one file and others, i see they contain important info. i can mask some data in it passphrase :

is that possible? gang: for esxi servers it's not possible victim: why not? please educate me to i can understand and tell the management not to waste time. we have way too many vendors here gang: the encryptor software rewrites the key from memory. victim: what? : ... liek in simple words please? gang: array of bytes in memory where the key resides in rewrites to prevent such operation victim: thats awesome. is this for all servers or only esxi? gang: for all of course victim: so if we end-up hiring a company that charges us 400 an hour, its pretty much useless? victim: btw, the array of memory that you mentioned, these are the public keys or the private keys? gang: encryptor even don't know anything about private keys. it only has public keys. public keys need to encrypt random field which uses in encryption process. gang: in my opinion spending money to external it companies will only waste your valuable time. victim: thanks, appreciate it. its clear to me now victim: hey, how much data have you stolen 100gig?

victim: we do not have cybersecurity insurance, we are having to scrape together money that was budgeted for other projects. you've already hurt the business enough with the disruption, but to ask more for ransom means you hurt us a second time. please consider that and let us pay you the 65k that we have available so we can all get back to normal. gang: 65.000 and 900.000 why do you think we should agree to 1 14?

victim: if we needed the decryptor, i could understand you continuing to ask for the massive amount you are asking for, but we don't need the decryptor. we just want your promise and proof you destroyed our data. how much is that worth to you? if we can't get to a number that is realistic and affordable to us, you will get nothing. victim: also, we cannot pay until tuesday when the banks open again monday is a holiday if we can settle on a price. victim: you threatened us with a deadline of the end of this week. i would appreciate you removing that deadline so that we can continue to discuss price. again, if you publish, you get nothing. standing by gang: reputation is expensive, of course 155k good money but it is still not enough. if you want this dialogue to not last and we resolve the issue quickly, we can make a super offer given that you do not need a decryptor. super offer 400.000 and we agree. victim: thank you for your willingness to work with us on price. as i mentioned, money is in short supply. i have been authorized to increase our offer to 175k with a promise to pay tuesday for your promise and proof of deletion. please understand we are not able to offer more and will have to pay you in at least two seperate payments 1 big 1 smaller . if this is ok, we can agree and will prepare everything for tuesday. gang: you didn't appreciate our offer. when we make such discounts, we wait for retaliatory steps. we can also make such discounts in the end you pull time, our time is expensive. your price returns to original and considering your offer is 650,000 victim: hi, your withdrawal of the price creates serious confidence and trust issues for our leadership. we offered all we could in a show of support for your new price, and then you withdrew it. we need you to offer serious prices only, continuing to dither on the price will result in nothing. please reconsider. gang: we offered you a serious price, you in turn did not appreciate this offer. you were the first to show your frivolity and desire to play games with us with an increase in offers by 20,000. you didn't appreciate the seriousness of our move. you can fix it. victim: you can characterize our offers in whatever way makes you happy, however you still hold nothing in your hand. if you want a productive conversation, let's start at 175k and see where it goes. we have to get approval to offer money to you, and that approval comes in small increments. it is just the nature of how our leadership operates. if you don't like it, sorry. you attacked us. gang: offer 175,000 rejected. make the best offer. victim: i will inform leadership victim: our final super-offer is 250k, and we can begin payment today. standing by. gang: super offer 350.000 and we agree. victim: hi, i have informed leadership that you declined the super offer and of your new offer. victim: i will return with their response. victim: hi. leadership replied that if you can't meet us at our offer of 250k just for deletion, then give us the decryptor, destroy our data, and promise not to disclose the data for 300k. gang: 325.000 and we agree. victim: ok, i will inform leadership. we will give you files to prove you can decrypt prior to payment, if leadership agrees. we can pay 150k per day if leadership accepts. victim: leadership agrees to 325,000. we will begin paying tomorrow, it will take until tuesday to get it done completely. victim: we would like to get the file tree from you after partial payment tomorrow, we can get the rest from you after final payment, if you are ok with that. victim: if you need to wait until final payment for all items, just let us know, but the file tree will be useful now rather than at the end. victim: please provide payment instructions and address victim: hi, we are approaching the end of the day for us to be able to make payment today. we need the payment instructions gang: btc wallet: [redacted] gang: 325.000 victim: hi, first payment sent 150.000 , next payment in 24hrs 150.000 , then final payment 24 hrs after that one 25.000 victim: hi, second payment sent 150.000 , next payment in 24 hrs 25.000 victim: can you acknowledge payment?

gang: support: ok. we could give additional discount and price now is 44btc. gang: support: we could even make some more, so price is 39btc. gang: support: so what is your decision? victim: [redacted]: i am taking your latest price of 39btc to our team and seeing if we can get any additional budget approved. gang: support: how long will it take? victim: [redacted]: we will have a decision to you this week. gang: support: it is taking too long. we want to know it tomorrow. you have talk to your bosses and explain them the seriousness of the situation. also they should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data. victim: [redacted]: yes, this is a severe incident for us, but we just simply dont have the money. our offer of 15btc still stands if you want to accept it, but we cant pay what youre asking. gang: support: that is not reasonable price for so huge batch of data. you should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data. so, our offer is 25btc. victim: [redacted]: ok. we appreciate the discount to 25btc but, that is still more than we can afford. we don't have that kind of cash on hand. we are certainly willing to try and work something out with you because we don't want any more of our data posted but, 15btc is the maximum we can pay. please let us know if 15 btc is enough. gang: support: of course, we understand, that your work here is not easy and requires efforts to convince your board members. but we do not want to waste our time. so you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. if we don't reach an agreement, we'll just shorten our profit. and on other hand, you would be ruined. gang: support: so when will you proceed with the payment? otherwise we will start to public data tomorrow. victim: [redacted]: it took a lot of debate to get to this 15btc, i'm not sure 25btc will ever be possible. i will talk with the board and let them know about the 25btc and see what they think. like i said, we want to try and work something out with you so, we will update you in the next couple of days. gang: support: we think that you do not understand the seriousness and waste our time. also you are making all movements very slow. also, you could split the amount, pay us 15btc and we will give decrypt tool for example. the rest 10btc you could in 2 weeks and we will delete your data. so, we will start to upload your data anyway today, maybe it will rush you and your boss. victim: [redacted]: if you upload any more data we will no longer pay anything. we dont need the decryption program. we just need our data deleted. for now, our offer still stands. gang: support: so when do you proceed with the payment? we could accept 15btc without decryption tool, just for data. gang: support: in the event that you and we do not reach a consensus, we will start publishing and selling your private information very soon. please keep us writing notifying how it is going if there is still no success, so we understand that you are still with us. victim: [redacted]: we are working on figuring out how to get bitcoin and will let you know when we have it. gang: support: ok. keep updating us please. gang: support: how is it going so far? victim: [redacted]: i'm sorry, when we original had 15btc approved, the price of bitcoin was much lower. with the new price of bitcoin, we can no longer afford 15btc. when we tried to get the purchase approved, it wasn't approved because its almost 100,000 more than we originally had approved when we made the offer. gang: support: we could not control the btc rate and it is your problem that you wasted time. we mean that you borrow additional funds somewhere. gang: support: so should we start posting of your data? gang: support: well we start to publish your data. here is the web link: https: continews.best [redacted] if you want to stop that process you have last chance for that. otherwise the most valuable part of info will be sold on the black markets and the the rest will be published. private data of your employees and clients is under the risk, you have to think about it. gang: support: should we start to sell the data of your employees and patients?

gang: support: as i remember you do not need a decryption tool. am i mistaken? most of the discount was provided based on the fact that you do not need the decryption. victim: [redacted]: there are some files that would save us time. 400,000 is not a small amount. gang: support: that is way below our offer. yes, surely the decryptor would save you some time, and time means money. the 600k offer was for the data we hold. as you must understand we have some experience in negotiations, and you are trying to put us in the position that you think we accept, based on the basic information that is in the the press about usual sum we get. relying on the press or public opinion is a mistake. about 75 of our deals are never leaked to the public or revealed. we will be waiting for your decision by tomorrow. 600k for the files or something better for full pack. victim: [redacted]: yes, we know you are very experienced. we can sense it. all we're doing is seeing how much money we can spend, and 400,000 is an large sum. if we go down this path, then we certainly want all of the items that are available. victim: [redacted]: we've read about you in the press but we have no idea about the usual sum that you get. no one here wants to play games, and that's why we're trying to finalize the deliverables in advance. we want a solution and we assume you want to get paid. but 400,000 is only available if we can get everything. how else can we afford to pay that much? gang: support: the 400k is too low anyways. i will talk to my boss and try to get an offer for 600k that will contain the decryptor. give me few hours. victim: [redacted]: alright - your best offer that includes the decryptor will be taken under very serious consideration. thank you. gang: support: talked to my boss. when he heard about the decryption tool being needed, at first he was ready to move back to the previous offer or at least move to 1.2mil x2 from the data offer , but we've decided not too be hard on you and are ready to stay at 750k. take this to the management and let me know what they decide. victim: [redacted]: i appreciate you trying. we have a lot of money set aside for this but 750,000 just won't be possible. if the price was 600,000 then we may have been able to push closer to that. but at 750,000, it is just so far... gang: support: we can leave it 600k if the transfer will be done today or tomorrow. the btc wallet is : [redacted] victim: [redacted]: let me discuss with the team. this is still above our budget but we can try to work towards it quickly. thanks. victim: [redacted]: we took this management and discussed. they were certainly appreciative of you being able to include the decryptor in the 600,000 price. while the price itself is still high for us, we feel more confident in being able to move past this with you. we may be paying more than the value, but want to keep the positivity in our discussions. as a result, we can increase our offer to 450,000 and can begin the transfer soon if you are with us. thank you. gang: support: 600k. take it back. gang: support: and the sum will be increased if we will not receive the funds within mentioned time frames. victim: [redacted]: well, increasing the sum is not going to get us any closer. i will get back to you in a bit. victim: [redacted]: we had an early morning call. 450,000 is our limit and this is more than what we anticipated paying. we can start the payment process soon if you can agree. otherwise, this may not be the ending we had hoped for. victim: [redacted]: we know you worked hard to make this work and we appreciate it. it's just that we're at our limit. gang: support: you still have a little time to conclude an agreement on the terms above. then the price will increase. victim: [redacted]: we have worked day and night to make this work and we understand you're doing the same. if the price goes up then there is no way we can pay. all we ask is for a little help so that we can get the cash in your hands. 450,000 is not a small amount for us. gang: support: i'm sorry. i'll talk to the boss today, but i'm afraid he'll stand his ground. victim: [redacted]: thank you. that would be helpful victim: [redacted]: did you talk to your boss today? gang: support: not yet, will update you as soon as he replies. gang: support: ok. 450k. btc wallet : [redacted] victim: [redacted]: thank you. can you confirm what we will receive in return of a 450,000 payment?

gang: support: [redacted].docx [ 12kb ] gang: support: [redacted].docx [ 15kb ] victim: [redacted]: thank you. i'm waiting for information about what files you took. regarding our revenue, if this happened last year at this time, paying this much wouldn't have been a problem. but with the pandemic and financial crisis, people just aren't buying cars. we have a large inventory that isn't selling and by holding onto this inventory like we are, we're actually losing more money than making money. it will take us months to crawl out of this problem to start making a profit. revenue is not profit, as you know. gang: support: the static shows opposite. a lot of sources say that people start to buy cars more, because of pandemic. anyway what is your best proposal?

victim: [redacted]: we're working on how much we can afford to pay you, but my boss is asking for some more information. are you able to send some more files? 7 files is a tiny amount when you say you took 1 tb. gang: support: here is several more files: download: https: qaz.im load [redacted] delete: https: qaz.im index.php?a delete q [redacted] pass [redacted] victim: [redacted]: we reviewed the financials and we can pay you 72,380, but only if you promise to make all our files open and usable again and give back all the files you took. gang: support: that is not enough. we could reduce the price and give you a new offer 700,000 . you should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data ids, ssn, credit cards . victim: [redacted]: i can see why you would think that. in reality, regardless if the files you took end up on your news site or not, i still have the same legal requirements and exposure. this was the case the second the files were taken, not if the files get posted or not. i have already begun the notifications to everyone whose data was affected, so it doesn't matter if the files are posted or not. now, would i prefer the files not be posted, of course i would. only because i care about my employees and my customers. victim: [redacted]: you need to understand that the reason i'm here is to get my files unlocked. i'm already taking a huge financial hit taking care of the legal notifications and the fees associated with that. i just want my files back and unlocked. victim: [redacted]: i spent all weekend with my finance guy reviewing the accounts and savings and were able to pull together 72,380. business has not been good during the past year and what you're asking for is impossible. with covid and the financial crisis, many people are out of work and aren't making large purchases. the people who are lucky enough to still have jobs are working from home and aren't buying new cars. i know you are the only person who can unlock the files, so this is why i'm willing to pay you the 72,380 that i have left. you can understand my situation, right? gang: support: we don't think, that our estimates are incorrect. your financial reports are somewhat more reliable, than your word here and now. and your proposal here is just from the textbooks - ten times less, than our initial demand. it seems, that you do not understand, how works our group. we don't ask 20 millions, to receive our demand of 750,000.so you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. if we don't reach an agreement, we'll just shorten our profit. gang: support: also, your notifications will not save private data of your employees and customers, it will be used long time in many bad purposes. think about your reputation, which will be damaged in so hard times for business. victim: [redacted]: i understand what you're saying and know you are a famous group. i have googled you and know you are professionals. i know you do this all the time, but please put yourself in my shoes for a moment. there is nothing textbook about this. nobody saw this pandemic and financial crisis coming. i had no idea that 2020 was going to be as bad as it was. i still have inventory on my lot from 13 months ago. that's unheard of in my business! i'm hoping 2021 turns around and is better, but until then, i'm just trying to survive. car dealerships are very low margin, meaning that if i'm able to sell a few cars, the revenue doesn't necessarily cover my bills or employee salaries. i need to sell a certain level of inventory to make a profit and most months i didn't. i've had to furlough employees just to try to keep the dealership open. i'm willing to do whatever it takes and to work with you for as long as it takes, but i only have 72,380 that i can pay you to unlock my files. gang: support: of course, we understand, that your work here is not easy and requires efforts to convince your board members. but we are still far from agreement. our estimates are still much higher, than your proposal. we hope, that you will give us better price. and since it is our mutual interest to speed up our negotiations as much, as we can - take more serious steps toward us. it would be much easier than for us to make steps to you in response. victim: [redacted]: i want to get you your money to get my files back. i know you put time and effort into this and want to get paid. we both want the same thing here. you see this, right? the only obstacle that i have that i need your help with is the high price. i just don't have that much. i worked to get 72,380 from my accounts to pay you. gang: support: that is not enough. there is many ways how you could get additional funds. you could apply on the loan in the bank or take out your savings or cut expenses or sell something and etc. you are just wasting time now. victim: [redacted]: i don't understand why the price is so high. you obviously know what my financial situation is and know that i can't possibly afford to pay you this much. for a bank to give me a loan, they'll examine my current situation, look at my debt to income ratio and see if i'm actually profitable. i already know what they're going to tell me. i'm too risky. can't we skip all of this time wasting and let me pay you? gang: support: ok. we could reduce the price and offer the new amount 500,000 . the price is more then reasonable for that data and your reputation. victim: [redacted]: how is asking for over 400k more than what i can afford to pay you help our situation? gang: support: we told you above that there is several ways to find additional funds. victim: [redacted]: i'm meeting with a loan officer at the bank today. gang: support: keep updating us please. victim: [redacted]: good news. we were approved for a loan for the amount of 45,500. this makes the total amount that i can pay you 117,880. i requested 400k, but due to my debt-to-income ratio and current liabilities, 45,500 is the most they could approve for me. i have contact other lending firms and they all tell me that's the most i can be approved for, based on my credit and current financials. victim: [redacted]: we've been at this over a week now. we both want the same thing, a payment to get data back. i've done all i can at this point. please, can we agree so i can pay you? this is why you did this, right? gang: support: we need some time to discuss this offer. victim: [redacted]: this is a long holiday weekend and if i can't pay soon, i won't be able to until mid-next week. gang: support: we could the offer today but it should be more profitable. we could give you some more discount and offer new price 400,000 . victim: [redacted]: i don't understand. i've pulled all the cash from out of the business and i put my neck out on the line for a loan to come up with 117,880. i don't have any other options. 400k is impossible for me. i can pay you 117,880 right away. it will take weeks or months before i can pay anything close to 400k. victim: [redacted]: are you there? please let me know if i can pay you 117,880. i understand that you want to make good money for your work, but this is as much as i can possible pay. i can't get another loan. gang: support: we looked throw your finance records, bank accounts and know that you have more available funds. we are ready to give you some discount, but that price is not reasonable. we own a lot of private data which cost much more. victim: [redacted]: i had to meet with a loan advisor to get more funds to pay you. i want to fix this problem and work with you but i can't afford anymore then 117,880. this is all i have. we have been out of service during covid and i can't come up with anymore money. gang: support: you have more funds on your accounts. gang: support: we are ready to accept 200,000 . gang: support: are you ready to pay? victim: [redacted]: i need to meet with the bank to see what my options are and how much more i can borrow. monday is a federal holiday and the bank is closed. i'll meet with them first thing in the morning on tuesday and i'll let you know. victim: [redacted]: how do i pay you? would the bank pay you? gang: support: we accept only bitcoins. victim: [redacted]: okay i'll start looking into bitcoin as well. i'll have an update tomorrow gang: support: there is several ways how you could exchange funds. you should check google and choose the most convenient for you. victim: [redacted]: i found a good bitcoin site. i have a call with the bank in a little bit and i'll let you know how it goes. gang: support: ok. keep updating us please. victim: [redacted]: it took some convincing, but i was able to get a 27,000 addendum to my previous loan. with the total loan amount of 72,500 and everything from my accounts, i can pay you 144,880. i have a bitcoin wallet account all set up and ready to use. gang: support: we reduce price as much as we can. we totally sure that you had sales during this time, so you have sources from where you could add funds. victim: [redacted]: there have been no sales since this attack. you have locked up all the computers, leaving me not able to operate at all. this is why i've been working on getting a loan and begging and borrowing money from anyone i can. gang: support: we went as low as we could. the price is little more then 20 from starting amount. it is very huge discount, especially if we remind that we own a lot of valued documents, credit cards and etc. we could not cut our profit anymore. gang: support: i made a request to my managers about additional discount anyway. victim: [redacted]: thank you. i really want to pay you to get my computers unlocked. gang: support: we understand that and that's why we gave you so huge discount. we do not have purpose to ruin your business. victim: [redacted]: i understand. we both want the same thing. we both want a payment so i can get my files back. i'm short 55k and have no other options. gang: support: we are ready to reduce a little more a price. the new offer is 185,00. victim: [redacted]: okay, thank you. i'll need more time to find the funds. in addition to getting my files unlocked, what else does a payment get me? gang: support: we will return all your data and provide security report. victim: [redacted]: what about the files you took? you will give that back as well? how does that work? will you be able to provide proof that you deleted all the files? gang: support: we will give you all files and delete them from the cloud. it is not a problem. we never treat clients who paid us, we play only fear games. victim: [redacted]: i'm trying today to collect more money for you. gang: support: ok. keep updating us please victim: [redacted]: i'm sorry to say this, but i still only have 144,880. i'm short a little more than 55k. the bank refuses to lend me more. i tried a couple special financing companies, but after running my credit, refuse to lend me any funds. i've asked friends and family and all are hurting more than me and can't help. i just don't know what to do now. gang: support: ok. so we could split the payback. you pay us what you have now and we provide you the decrypt tool. after you pay the rest, we provide your data back. victim: [redacted]: i don't feel comfortable splitting up the payments. i rather pay you once and be done forever. victim: [redacted]: i know you must do this all day, but i just don't see how 144,880 isn't enough to unlock my files. gang: support: it is not enough compare to your revenue and data which we got from you. so you could use this option and pay in two steps. you could start to work properly even today and find the rest very fast. victim: [redacted]: i'll need more time to collect more money. i don't have a lot of options left. the business is closed down because of this attack. i'll see what i can do. if i can't pay, can i come back here in a couple of month when i have the money? will you still be here? gang: support: we could not wait also. why could you just split the payback and start to work today? victim: [redacted]: because i'm scarred to death about paying all i have today and this still going on. no offense to you at all when i say this, but this has been the worst experience of my life. all i want is for this to be over. the stress and anxiety has been unbearable. gang: support: we understand that and this is a reason why we gave so huge discount and offer you to split the payment. it is good option for you. the company will start to work today and you could earn the little rest very fast. victim: [redacted]: i'm working on collecting more money for you today. victim: [redacted]: okay, i got 162,792. this is from an extra 17,912. 9,500 was from a personal loan, 3,655 is from personal savings and 4,757 is from a collection the workers did. this puts me at 162,792 that i can pay you. i literally have nothing else to give. i owe a huge debt of gratitude to my workers for their help and need to pay them back asap. i have a bitcoin wallet account ready, all i need to do is transfer the funds from the bank. please let me know. gang: support: ok. we could accept that price. here is the wallet: [redacted] victim: [redacted]: thank you. i'm working on getting the money transferred from my bank to the bitcoin account. victim: [redacted]: after i pay, you will give me a tool to unlock all my files, right? you will also give back all the files you took, prove you deleted them and give me information about how you got in so i can make sure this doesn't happen again? gang: support: that is correct. as soon as we receive payment we provide required info. gang: support: how is it going so far? gang: support: when do you expect to proceed with the payment? gang: support: you should confirm the wallet before transfer. victim: [redacted]: hi. i had trouble with my bank. they didn't allow me to transfer the funds to a my bitcoin wallet because they suspected fraud. i got it cleared up and the wire has started, but it hasn't arrived yet. because it didn't arrive today, it won't arrive until monday morning. is this okay??? before i transfer the money to you, i will reconfirm your wallet. gang: support: ok. keep updating us please. victim: [redacted]: all ready to send you 162,792. is your btc wallet still [redacted]? if it changed, please let me know. gang: support: here is the new wallet: [redacted] victim: [redacted]: okay, sending 162,792 to [redacted] victim: [redacted]: just confirming, [redacted]. you said it's new, but it's the same one you provided last week. it's still the correct wallet?

what is it then https: qaz.im load [redacted]? invite a person to chat who really solves such issues. we are not ready to negotiate with an incompetent person. victim: [redacted]: we don't have 15,000,000 worth of insurance. even if we had a policy worth that much, it's not as simple as having them write a blank check for us. gang: support: of course, the price is high, but it is much, much more cheaper, than pay to all the lawsuits, that your clients will send to you, because you have lost so much of their data. companies of your size can lost tens of millions in such cases. https: www.zdnet.com article easyjet-faces-18-billion-class-action-lawsuit-over-data-breach this is one of the examples. victim: [redacted]: that's a massive airline. we're a healthcare center in [redacted]. victim: [redacted]: if you can decrypt our files, then we see value in that. but as time goes on, the value of that significantly decreases. we're here to listen and we will be ready to make an agreement with you for the right price. we just can't put effort into this if you will only accept tens of millions of dollars. gang: support: we will provide the decrypt tool to you as soon as we receive payment. it uses very easy. also we could decrypt several files more as samples. gang: support: we have not yet heard from you an adequate price. the longer you drag out, the more you incur losses. we have a lot of experience in this area and we are perfectly aware of how much a company like you can pay. let's not waste time and move on to specific steps. we are waiting for an adequate offer from you. gang: support: good morning, please transfer these files to albert maury and ann mary pardo https: www.sendspace.com file [redacted] victim: [redacted]: thank you. leadership is constantly monitoring the situation and they are fully aware. can you communicate to us only via this site so that there is no confusion? victim: [redacted]: we will have an update for you within the next hour and we think you will view it as a positive sign as well. we'll be in touch. gang: support: ok we will keep all in secret while you are negotiating with us. victim: [redacted]: the team met this morning and they reviewed all potential options. the insurance policy doesnt provide free money and there are already many costs that are being applied to the policy. expenses add up quick. even with that, we are interested in coming to terms at an amount that is both realistic and worth your efforts. to that end, we are ready to send 1,200,000 in return for decryption and deletion of the files that you have. gang: support: thank you for your offer. but unfortunately we must reject it. we have studied your bank statements and you have sufficient funds in your accounts to find the required amount. we are ready to meet you and reduce the price to 12,500,000. victim: [redacted]: we received your phone call. i am authorized to negotiate with you and leadership is fully aware of this situation. please communicate with me here as distractions will only slow this process down. victim: [redacted]: we are offering a significant amount of cash. if you know everything about our company, then you know that 12,500,000 is not possible. we are on the front lines of caring for patients and we wouldnt let this amount get in our way if we actually had the balance available. victim: [redacted]: if youre here for the money, then lets make realistic goals. if youre here to see patients suffer, then we will solve this on our own. gang: support: as i told you before you offer 1,200,000 is unacceptable. we appreciate your desire to resolve this situation quickly and are waiting for your specific proposals? victim: [redacted]: 1,200,000 is not a small proposal. coming to us with arbitrary numbers will not solve anything because we cant afford those amounts. how are we supposed to pay when we dont have the money? gang: support: i think you are being disingenuous when you say that there is no money. we've seen your bank statements. at the same time, the insurance company will fully reimburse you for losses from the incident. we reviewed the insurance and consulted with experts. if you want to get more discounts, give more worthwhile arguments. we are waiting for an adequate offer. victim: [redacted]: where in the insurance does it say that we have coverage for 12,500,000? victim: [redacted]: we do have an insurance policy and we are not denying that. but there are many aspects of our business that need to be reimbursed by this claim and a payment to you is only a portion of it. if we had insurance money then we would easily pay this amount since it wouldnt impact us. but thats not the case. gang: support: so you want to reach an agreement and get the desired result? or will we just exchange unnecessary remarks? we are waiting for a new price offer from you. victim: [redacted]: yes, we want to reach a desired result. you seem like a business focused group and we appreciate that. we are certainly open to making a payment and that is why we offered a large amount. we just dont have the capacity to quickly add a few million dollars to our offer. other expenses are mounting and the value of your tool decreases over time. victim: [redacted]: can you give us a price that leadership wont walk away from? gang: support: amount of money we want is just a small piece of your possible losses including but not limiting direct expenses such as payments for data recovery, dramatic cash flow drop, legal government fines, attorneys lawyers interests, but also reputation impact resulting in long-term customer abandonment. gang: support: we are ready to take one more step towards you and make a discount of 2,500,000. your price now is 10m victim: [redacted]: thank you. we agree that paying you will allow us to recover a few days earlier. victim: [redacted]: but outside of that, we still have to pay it and attorney costs no matter what. and even if you delete the data, we still have to face legal and government fines. our entire conversation is simply to save a few days, and we are offering 1,200,000 for this. were just trying to have a conversation with you so that we can put the best price on the table for leadership. otherwise, theyre just going to walk away since they cant manage to pay millions and millions of dollars. gang: support: you are cunning again. you won't bear any legal and government fines if we reach an agreement. we have already gave you a huge discount. and now we are waiting for your offer. you can go to your leadership and tell him that the price now is 10m.we have great experience.and we know what losses you will incur if your private information is published. victim: [redacted]: you say that we won't bear any legal and government fines if we reach an agreement. we still have yet to see any health data that would require such notifications. what info do you have that is so valuable and worth 10,000,000? victim: [redacted]: that is an honest question. we hope you can help clarify. gang: support: good morning. why are you asking questions that have already been answered? the full file tree will be provided to you only after payment. unfortunately, we already had a sad experience when we gave a complete list of downloaded data before paying. in our opinion, we have provided you with a fairly complete picture that we have all sensitive information that was stored on your file servers, sql databases, as well as in your medical programs. if you want to take the risk and not negotiate with us, then this is your right. but trust our experience that in this case your expenses will far exceed the cost of 10 million. victim: [redacted]: yes, we see how some companies would disappear after receiving a full file tree. all we want to see is some files from our sql database as well as medical programs. the information that we've seen thus far does not justify a 10,000,000 payment. it's hard to discuss payment when the value is much lower than the price. gang: support: if you think that your personal data is cheaper, offer a price. 1,200,000 is unacceptable. gang: support: also you can see a full file tree for free when we will published it on our cartel's news site. victim: [redacted]: we will see what we can do. there is value in the decryptor but that is diminishing as time goes on. leadership can't pay much, especially if we're not seeing the medical files. gang: support: it's up to you. if your leadership wants to destroy the business for 1.2m it his choice. victim: [redacted]: we dont want to destroy the business and we understand that it is not your intention to either. we have said from the beginning that we can pay for your services, but we cant spend millions and millions, especially without having evidence of the medical files that you have. victim: [redacted]: leadership is taking you seriously and for now, they have approved a payment of 1,700,000 in an effort to move past this. we just dont know how long this money can stay on the table before we spend it elsewhere. gang: support: according to your financial reports your situation is much better than you say. as a group with an estimated yearly revenue 0.5billion you have enough money to pay us. we are giving you one more discount and the price now is 8,000,000 victim: [redacted]: revenue isn't money that we keep in our pockets. that's simply a top line number before we account for all expenses. if we had 0.5nillion sitting in our account, then we wouldn't waste time over a few million dollars. victim: [redacted]: more importantly, we have yet to see any information related to our medical records and databases. we're trying to move this along and we assume that you don't have time to waste. if you can provide some of those files, then it would be beneficial to both of us. gang: support: sql databases are very large. to download them, we compressed them. all your data is archived on servers. you are not the only company with which we are negotiating and we have neither time nor free disk space to unzip the data of each locked client. gang: support: we can unzip all your downloaded databases, analyze information from them and provide you with data. but it will take a long time and most importantly, we will return to the original price. i don't think it will suit you. victim: [redacted]: we have 1,700,000 that we can pay now. our expenses are mounting and we don't know how long this money will be on the table. if you can't provide samples of the sensitive files, then where do we go from here? gang: support: we don't think, that our estimates are incorrect. your financial reports are somewhat more reliable, than your word here and now. and your proposal here is just from the textbooks - five times less, than our initial demand. it seems, that you do not understand, how works our group. we don't ask 150 millions, to receive our demand of 15 millions. so you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. if we don't reach an agreement, we'll just shorten our profit. and on other hand, you would be ruined. we have already gave you a huge discount. we'll wait for your serious proposal. victim: [redacted]: we already need to treat this as a data leak, regardless of whether we pay you or not. your decryptor has some value but the value decreases daily and you still have yet to provide us with the sensitive medical records. victim: [redacted]: even without the evidence, we are offering a large sum. it cannot be compared to an arbitrary demand of 15,000,000 as that was not possible from the beginning. we know youre a sophisticated group but we have limits as our business cant handle a payment of 8,000,000. were here to work out a solution with you, and all we ask is that we pay an amount that is actually attainable. gang: support: of course, we understand, that your work here is not easy and requires efforts to convince your board members. but we are still far from agreement. our estimates are still much higher, than your proposal. we hope, that you will give us better price. and since it is our mutual interest to speed up our negotiations as much, as we can - take more serious steps toward us. it would be much easier than for us to make steps to you in response. victim: [redacted]: can you provide any other files to help us convince our board members? gang: support: not today. as i told you before we need to unzip the archives. gang: support: if you can wait we will try to speed up the process. but i really don't know how long does it takes us. victim: [redacted]: ok thank you victim: [redacted]: this could help convince the board to increase the amount so let us know once you have an estimate. gang: support: my tech just told me that it could take us up to 3 days. victim: [redacted]: yes, the board would like to see those files gang: support: here some proof for the board https: dropfiles.org [redacted] gang: support: more coming... but i think above archive is enough to make a right decision. am i correct? victim: [redacted]: these seem to be additional files from the same folders that you've already provided to us. it helps but we're interested in the rest of the archive that supposedly contains the medical files. gang: support: we are now sure that you are just trying to drag out time. before that, you said that our decryptors are losing value every day. now you say that you are ready to wait for some files for 3 days. you are a bad poker player and a bad negotiator. we will, of course, provide you with another randomly selected sql base,just to confirm that we are not bluffing you it takes some time . we suggest that you have to decide whether you give us a serious proposal now or we begin to publish your data and notify your patients, clients, etc. victim: [redacted]: yes, the decryptors lose value everyday. if the price was close to 1,700,000, then we wouldve already had a deal by now. however, if the price is 8,000,000 then we see no quick solution to this problem because that price isnt justified. we have no other option but to wait because we would never be able to pay close to 8,000,000. if we see some more files then we may be able to pay slightly more. and if any of the data is published, then our price goes to 0 instantly. victim: [redacted]: were not here to play games and we know youre not interested in that either. we're both business minded. it would be a shame to leave 1,700,000 on the table and walk away. gang: support: good morning. as i promised earlier i will send you one sql base from server [internal ip address] . it's still preparing. but i won't give you any more files. if we do not come to an agreement, then you will see all your databases for free on the cartel's news servers. there will be many surprises for you. gang: support: download: https: qaz.im load [redacted] delete: https: qaz.im index.php?a delete q [redacted] passwod - [redacted] gang: support: https: mega.nz file [redacted] gang: support: so we are waiting for final offer from you and will decide with our team what to do. 1,700,000 is not acceptable anyway. victim: [redacted]: we're checking the files and will let you know once the board discusses gang: support: thanks. victim: [redacted]: the board just wrapped up their meeting. they saw from the start that you had our data and agree that there is some sensitive information. they also know that well need to go public with this regardless of whether we pay or not. the people will find out about this no matter what. victim: [redacted]: our insurance funds are slowly decreasing and there is less upside to paying. they do feel that youve made an effort to be transparent and there is still interest in bringing this to a close if it can occur soon. 2,350,000 can be delivered to you under the right terms. we dont know how much longer theyll want to discuss this but for now, the money is there. well wait for you. gang: support: good morning. we've discussed your proposal with team, and we are ready to make another discount. your price is now 6'250'000. of course, we are ready to move on further, depending on your offers. time is crucial here, so the more serious steps you will take in our direction, the faster we will get an agreement. we understand, that any downtime of your business is not in your interests, it is quite costly. possible losses, however, are much more expensive. but in fact, your downtime is not in our interests too, i can assure you. we know, that you have insurance, reserves, and possibility of loans. your overall reserve is quite better, than your proposal. make better offer, and we will move on. victim: [redacted]: our insurance reserves are dwindling as there are many other costs that have been incurred. new machines and tech labor are not cheap and we dont have a different cash lifeline to tap. weve practically reached our limit and the board took great measures to offer 2,350,000. victim: [redacted]: were not viewing this as a negotiation. we have offered all available funds and it seems silly to pay when we still have to deal with the consequences of a leak. paying millions for a temporary band aid doesnt make financial sense... gang: support: so this is your final proposal? victim: [redacted]: right now we have no room for additional funds victim: [redacted]: also our tech team can't access the sql file you passed over. we can't even assess what information is on that file. it may be corrupt. gang: support: i will convey your decision to my management. if it is rejected, then we start publishing your data. you have an hour to change your mind. gang: support: regarding sql, you already had worthless admins. and now they can't even attach a working file. i think this attack will be a good lesson for you and i will recommend the management not to conclude an agreement with you on the current terms. victim: [redacted]: if the data is published then all the money is gone. we can't pay a dime. we need time to discuss and can't make decisions in an hour. gang: support: the management rejected your offer. but today is friday the 13th and this is a bad date for making a decision. you have until monday to submit a new price. gang: support: no private information will be released until monday. but we ask you not to abuse our favor to you anymore. victim: [redacted]: we're not trying to abuse your favors. this is a lot of money and we simply don't have enough. covid has cause major strains on our business and we were in the midst of bracing for a lethal winter before we lost our files. we're juggling too much and we don't know how far the board will be able to take this. gang: support: good morning. we are waiting for your decision.thank you. victim: [redacted]: yes, we're discussing this morning. victim: [redacted]: the board just finished their discussion. our expenses are increasing quicker than expected and our balance sheet has been impacted drastically. the board thinks there is benefit to paying but we still are in no position to increase the amount. they mentioned that contacting the banks is still an option, but we wont get an answer today because its a complex issue. victim: [redacted]: we know youre busy and have other priorities, but our discussion has progressed over the past week and we still have 2,350,000 available. can we get a few days to work out potential financing with the bank? gang: support: we have just discussed your situation with the management, and we are ready to give you more time to find funds. victim: [redacted]: thank you. we will keep you updated. victim: [redacted]: while the board works on the financing side, can you provide screenshots of the database file that you shared? we still can't access the file and we're not sure what the issue is. gang: support: hello, as i already told you the database we sent you from sql base from server [internal ip address] may be it wouldn't work cause you need to decrypt other sql files from this server. victim: [redacted]: oh. so is there a way for you just to send us screenshots from the database file since we can view it? gang: support: nope cause all files are zipped. why are you asking this question again? your admins don't know what files they have on server [internal ip address]? victim: [redacted]: they just want to verify what specific data is on that file. a lot of money is on the line so we're trying to double check everything while we wait for the board. please let us know if there is anything else you can provide. thank you. gang: support: this is not what we agreed on. we gave you time to search for funds and not to fish out new information from us. we are waiting for a new proposal from you and we will give you a few more files. victim: [redacted]: we agree. the board is working with the bank. we're just having issues with the database file you sent so we figured we'd ask while we wait. gang: support: https: www.sendspace.com file [redacted] is this critical data for the board? victim: [redacted]: we'll take a look gang: support: the longer we study your files, the more important information we find in them. credit card information will be one of the most expensive in the event of a defect. victim: [redacted]: we wouldn't put 2,350,000 on the table if we weren't serious about this. i'm sure you understand that millions of dollars isn't easy to come by these days. victim: [redacted]: we hope to have an update soon but we'll be here in case you provide further files. gang: support: we are ready to listen to your proposal and after it we will give you more files. time is running out please don't delay. we have to close the deal this week. victim: [redacted]: yes, the board is working with the bank. we will keep pushing the urgency gang: support: how long will it take? let's arrange deadlines. victim: [redacted]: for now, the board has told us this week. there's a lot to review since we have other lenders and the bank doesn't want to be on the hook if those other lenders are paid first if there is an issue. victim: [redacted]: separately, our tech team is still having issues with the database file that you sent to us. can you send us a different database file? or at least a screenshot of the information in that database? gang: support: as i told you before we will share more files with you after your proposal. sorry my management told me not to make any exceptions. we already told you that we found a lot of credit card with cardholders info. victim: [redacted]: we understand. we're just trying to see if any of this may help the board gang: support: tell the board we have credit card details. they are not hundreds, but tens of thousands. victim: [redacted]: i know you've said you can't give more proof, but a few files will only help right now. especially if you can give us more insight into the database gang: support: sorry my management told me not to make any exceptions. victim: [redacted]: the board is meeting with the bank this afternoon. they need to present an in-depth analysis of our finances because the bank needs to do a understand the business thoroughly. there are concerns about our financial strength due to covid, so they requested a lot of files from us. the bank review may take another day or two but we are feeling optimistic on a loan. your patience is appreciated and we feel confident in an agreement. gang: support: good morning. thank you for an update. please keep us updating on each step from your board. we have to be sure that you are in touch and willing to close the deal. victim: [redacted]: yes, we certainly will. we're at the bank's mercy but they told us they will have an update by monday at the latest. victim: [redacted]: we got in touch with the bank again and we stressed that we need their decision by monday. they've agreed so can we get back to you with our proposal after the weekend? gang: support: hmmm. i'll need to check it with my management. gang: support: my management has consulted and gives you a reprieve until monday until 2-00 pm victim: [redacted]: thank you. we appreciate your patience. have a good weekend. gang: support: have a good weekend also. victim: [redacted]: we'll be in touch today. ok? gang: support: ok victim: [redacted]: we have good news. the bank normally doesnt expedite such requests but they prioritized our submission. weve had many hardships over the last few months and our financials have become unstable, but the bank still approved a small loan which was a surprise to us. we can now increase our offer to 2,800,000. the bank may be able to provide more funding, but theyll need to review further since this was a preliminary approval done on short notice. we know you are here to simply make a deal, so please let us know. gang: support: considering the steps you are taking, we are ready to make you a very good offer only if you quickly enter the deal. new price for you 5.000.000 victim: [redacted]: we were really hoping we could close this out but we understand that you have minimums that you need to reach. it's just that we're out of money and waiting on the bank at this point. we'll need to talk to the board. gang: support: how much time do you need? victim: [redacted]: we're getting in touch with the board and they'll need to reach out to the bank. the only issue is that it's a holiday week so we may not hear back until next week. we're going to try and expedite though because we can't keep wasting time. gang: support: let's define the amount of the deal. we are ready to divide this amount into 2 payments. for example, you pay 2,800,000 this week and receive decryptors. pay the rest in 2 weeks and get the rest. unfortunately, we do not have time to wait for you endlessly. victim: [redacted]: i understand your frustration with waiting for us, but we can't control how our board members spend their holidays. if you can give us until monday to figure this out we will greatly appreciate it. gang: support: we understand that your board is more puzzled by its holidays than by this problem. in our opinion, if people want to solve a problem quickly and not against the interests of other people, then they gather and make efforts for this.of course, we will give you time until monday only because we do not want ordinary employees and patients of your company to suffer from the leakage of their personal data. we also ask you to transfer to the board so that they speed up and do not delay solutions to this situation. victim: [redacted]: we appreciate that. the issue isn't entirely on the board members as we're working with the bank for more funding and they're simply not available during holidays. we don't want this hanging over our heads over the next few days but we don't have another option. your patience is appreciated. we will have an update for you on monday. victim: [redacted]: just letting you know that we're still working on this. banks are a pain to deal with during holidays but we're trying to pressure them. gang: support: thanks for an update. we can give you a good discount again if you are ready to make a deal on the price today.we are ready to divide the amount into 2 payments. gang: support: may be you can take an advice here... if you are serious about coming to an agreement, you should say something like... well, we don't have money now, but we can 100 find for example 4'800'000 in one week . and we can then figure something out from that position and wait for you to get things done for all that week . but if you are going to offer us 3'000'000 on monday, that will be viewed as an insult. we are trying to get to an strategic agreement here, and not approving 200'000 every day, what is a waste of time really. we are business people, after all, and we prefer to think, that you are business people too. we know, that you will receive compensation for any financial losses from your insurance. so the question is not in that point, that you can't afford to pay us 5'000'000, but in point, that you don't have enough funds right now . i think, we should talk about that. victim: [redacted]: the board is working diligently with the bank. it's just that the holiday has slowed things down since the bank is not fully staffed. trust us, if we knew there was a guarantee that we'd have certain funds available in a few days, then we would tell you. but there's just not much clarity right now. i can't get you any real answers today but the board will update us on monday. victim: [redacted]: the bank is still trying to work with us. they provided some initial insight on their analysis and we want to try and get more information to them before they make a decision on a loan, which will happen very soon. basically, we just want to get every detail in front of them to show how critical this payment really is. victim: [redacted]: do you have any additional files that you can share with us? anything else that could convince the bank to lend us more money? victim: [redacted]: the bank is our only remaining option and we just don't want to ruin our chances if we by not giving them all of the details. gang: support: good morning. so you are not going to give us any offer now? gang: support: https: www.sendspace.com file [redacted] victim: [redacted]: we're waiting on the bank but they should have an update soon. we just want to send additional details to make sure we get every last dollar from them gang: support: good morning. we still did not get any offer from you. if we don't hear it today, we will start publishing your private data. victim: [redacted]: yes, we are waiting on the bank to review some of the files you provided. should have more information today. please do not leak any data as it will erase all of our work thus far victim: [redacted]: can you also clarify what we will receive if we agree on a payment amount? gang: support: after the payment you will get decryptor to all your systems, full file tree of downloaded data, non-recoverable deletion with proof log and security report on how you were hacked. victim: [redacted]: alright, thanks. we may not hear back until later today but we'll send you an update before end of day. gang: support: ok we will wait. but please don't delay anymore. victim: [redacted]: were certainly moving much quicker than wed like but its difficult to get the bank to make rapid decisions. based on a discussion with them, we have preliminary approval for 3,100,000. they are still viewing this as a major risk but we continue to pressure them for assistance. we wanted to give you an update immediately even though they are still completing their review. we will wait for you. gang: support: we are trying to get to an strategic agreement here, and not approving 200,000- 300,000 every time, what is a waste of time really. we are business people, after all, and we prefer to think, that you are business people too. we know, that you will receive compensation for any financial losses from your insurance. so the question is not in that point, that you can't afford to pay us 5'000'000, but in point, that you don't have enough funds right now . i think, we should talk about that.please give us your final proposal and we will decide to accept it or not. as i told you before we can split the amount into 2-3 parts. but we need to make a strategic agreement on the amount.please decide and don't delay. time is over. victim: [redacted]: our issue is that the insurance policy has already been used for all of the other expenses we incurred. only a portion of those funds remain and that's why we're working with the bank. otherwise, we would've gladly used the insurance policy to pay and move on. the payment plan would work if we knew how much money we'd be able to gather, but we have no guarantees. what are we supposed to do if we're at the mercy of the bank? gang: support: you are not our first target who has insurance against such cases. and we know how much, what and how the insurance payments are spent. we are ready to give you the last discount. our conditions are as follows. you pay us 3.1m and we give you decryptor tool. until december 30th, you pay another 1m and we give you file tree of downloaded data, non-recoverable deletion with proof log and security report on how you were hacked. we guarantee you that no data will be released until december 30th. gang: support: please update us with your decision. victim: [redacted]: we certainly see that you are trying to make a deal with us and we understand your business approach. a payment plan would be great if we knew we could get an extra 1m, but only the bank can give us that excess cash. the insurance policy has been tapped and all of the remaining money has already been added to the 3.1m. we'll need to see what the bank is able to do but we can't agree to that right now. this is still 1m over budget. victim: [redacted]: we can get you an answer by tomorrow or friday since the bank should be able to wrap up their review. but nothing can be leaked while we try to get an extra 1m. ok? gang: support: our final price for you is 4,100,000. we expect your decision no later than friday 10-00am est. until that time, we guarantee that nothing will be made public. victim: [redacted]: ok we understand. we will let you know gang: support: good day. do you have a decision? victim: [redacted]: hello - we should by tomorrow morning. victim: [redacted]: good morning. weve been pressuring the bank over the past few days and we have received preliminary approval for 4,100,000. they will now seek internal approvals since this amount is higher than what they are usually comfortable lending out but it should be quick. even on our end, this will put our organization in a highly leveraged position, which is beyond our normal risk appetite. as you can see, this has been a learning experience like no other. victim: [redacted]: can you confirm what we will receive in return? gang: support: good morning. this is a serious approach to business.y ou will get decryptor to all your systems, full file tree of downloaded data, non-recoverable deletion with proof log and security report on how you were hacked. gang: support: also we will give you our advice on how to make your network more secure. gang: support: our btc wallet [redacted] victim: [redacted]: thank you. the bank should be able to give us the final approval by monday. gang: support: how much can you transfer today as the seriousness of your intentions? it's just that all the deadlines for your company have come out and my management requires this from me. victim: [redacted]: yes, we completely understand. we've been focusing solely on the loan since we used our cash for all of the other expenses. we don't have the money right now and need to wait on the bank to approve and wire it to us. they said today is not realistic but next week should be fine. gang: support: i have to report something to the management today. what is your specific suggestion? when are you ready to pay? victim: [redacted]: it will be next week. this has been an extraordinary challenge for us and we certainly want to get past it as quickly as possible. gang: support: ok. please update us on monday. i'll also tell you what time frame my leadership gives you. victim: [redacted]: thanks gang: support: good morning. please update us with payment time frame. victim: [redacted]: yes, the bank should give us an approval later today for the loan and then we can get the process started in terms of moving the cash to our account from the bank. we're getting very close! gang: support: please be more specific with exact day. victim: [redacted]: the loan is all set so the bank is working on the cash transfer now. they say it usually takes 2 days to transfer to the borrower, but obviously we're looking to expedite this. we don't have an exact date, but it'll be this week victim: [redacted]: the bank is still processing the payment. it takes them time to finalize the loan and then move the cash. it'll be this week though. gang: support: what is the loan amount? victim: [redacted]: 4,100,000. we had to rely on the bank for the full amount gang: support: good morning. our management asks you to explain why you are raising borrowed funds to pay off with us if you have enough own funds in your accounts? gang: support: [redacted] 10 15 2020.xlsx [ 375kb ] victim: [redacted]: that file is showing a negative balance. regardless, the balance that we do have is restricted by other lenders so we had to reach out to the bank for a new loan. the policy cant cover an amount this large so the bank is our only option. a lot of this is just out of our control. gang: support: my management wants to hear the answer today to the question: when will you transfer bitcoins to us? victim: [redacted]: we are aiming to transfer the bitcoin on friday. just waiting for the bank to send us the money gang: support: thank you for an update. we always keep the terms of the contract. your information will not be published or any other way disclosed. gang: support: good morning. do i understand correctly? the bank transfers money to your account today. tomorrow you transfer this amount to the broker and the broker will transfer it to us tomorrow? victim: [redacted]: that is the plan but this morning we received word that the bank has some concerns with ofac and the legality of paying. we know the government frowns upon these types of payments but our bank seems to be taking a more strict stance. it's frustrating because they didn't do this research during the loan phase, but now their compliance department has some questions. we're trying to see what the issue is. gang: support: ok but if we do not receive the payment on friday we will start publishing your private data. that's our final decision. gang: support: now we start to collect all patient's emails from data we have collected from your servers. all patients will be notified about the leakage of their personal data from your servers. gang: support: we have trusted you for a long time and now time is playing against you. gang: support: you have our btc wallet [redacted]. victim: [redacted]: trust us, we would've liked to finish this a long time ago too. there are just so many factors out of our control but we're trying to get to the bottom of this. weve done a lot of work up until this point, but we simply cant send 4,100,000 if you start reaching out to patients. gang: support: you are constantly pushing dates back. we have a strong opinion that you are just playing for time. if you really want to close the case, then you need to transfer any amount on friday to our btc wallet. otherwise, we will be forced to start the procedure for publishing your data. victim: [redacted]: this whole process took much longer than expected because we didn't have any extra cash to make a payment. we hate waiting for the bank but they're the ones in control now and they can be extremely slow. we're trying to hurry them but there seems to be a compliance issue since their money is going to be paid directly to you. this is extremely frustrating, especially since it's happening at the last second. you've been very patient and understanding, but we would hate to see all of this work go down the drain if the data is posted. gang: support: sorry, but we do not believe you that a company of your size does not have 200-300k on the account to make an advance payment as confirmation of your intentions. sorry, but you had enough time to solve your problems with the bank. gang: support: while you were solving your problems of finding money, we downloaded another 40gb of data with the diagnoses of your patients. gang: support: one more question. how can the bank pay us directly? victim: [redacted]: the bank is paying us but they nee to know exactly where the money is going since it's a loan. they put a pause on the process once compliance heard about the details. now we're trying to reason with them. gang: support: we cannot wait forever. therefore, we have set time x for you. if your intentions are serious, you will find a small amount for us. gang: support: if there is no money, then there is no agreement. i think when we start spreading your information it will spur you on and you will find money to save yourself from even larger losses. we consulted with lawyers and calculated that only the fines for the leakage of personal data will exceed the amount we ask for several times. i am not even mentioning what losses you will incur in the future because of a damaged business reputation. you have no more time. please make a decision on which path you are going. victim: [redacted]: we're trying to get more information from the bank. there's a lot of money on the line. gang: support: we have voiced our position to you. if you do not name a specific date today, then publication cannot be avoided. gang: support: you no longer need to write here that the bank is slowing down payment, etc. specifically, you must give the date of payment. the games are over. victim: [redacted]: tuesday the 15th. ok? gang: support: please confirm all conditions from your side for tuesday the 15th. victim: [redacted]: we will pay 4,100,000 once we receive approval from the bank. agreed? gang: support: our management is not happy with this answer. we need a specific date when you will pay and not an answer when maybe you will pay if ..... gang: support: as we understand, you do not want to resolve this issue peacefully. it's your right. victim: [redacted]: we certainly want to resolve this. we've worked days and nights to get this far. we're still aiming for tomorrow, the 15th. gang: support: can you clarify to us. we have just examined your main bank account [redacted] at [redacted] bank. you simply can pay the broker today from that account. there is enough money. victim: [redacted]: we can't use any of our own funds in this instance due to debt obligations. what information did you use to verify that account? gang: support: it seems to us that you are misleading us. what is the difference between the funds in the account now and those that will be credited tomorrow? victim: [redacted]: we physically cannot touch that money for this use. there are strict rules from a debt perspective and we can only use the money from the bank for this payment. right now, we're waiting on news from the bank regarding their compliance process. gang: support: there are a lot of inconsistencies. you yourself are already confused about what you wrote earlier in the chat. make a decision. you pay or not. we don't intend to wait any longer. gang: support: remember how much cash you said is on your table? gang: support: so you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. if we don't reach an agreement, we'll just shorten our profit. and on other hand, you would be ruined. that is much more serious threat, than none making payment to us. victim: [redacted]: yes, we were referring to the cash with the bank. we had other issues arise and it left us with no flexibility. we understand your terms and are rushing to finish this off. there's only so much we can do when the bank is in control. gang: support: could you give some proof that the bank is slowing down the loan payment? forward the emails from bank to [redacted] outlook.com victim: [redacted]: unfortunately, the bank would not be comfortable with us sharing any information. this is a private debt facilitation and their compliance team wouldn't approve. we don't want to risk anything at this stage. gang: support: my leadership is going to a meeting now. in an hour, a final decision will be made on you. gang: support: i have a final decision on [redacted]. the negotiations are over. you have 48 hour left to make a payment to our bitcoin wallet. before transferring bitcoins, you need to confirm the wallet. the countdown went from 3:00pm est. our management has developed a special plan in case the funds are not received on time. and for you it really will be a surprise . victim: [redacted]: this is unfortunate but we understand. we're sending this language to the bank to see if it will make them move faster. we just have no control right now. victim: [redacted]: the bank has acknowledged the deadline but we're still waiting on clarification from them regarding the status. gang: support: you must declare a personal data breach yourself or we will do it ourselves. gang: support: more than 1 million personal data will be published soon. gang: support: parse the internet and you will find a lot of interesting things about your company. gang: support: good morning. and why are we silent? gang: support: good day. do not think that we have forgotten about you. just busy at the end of the year with more important things. we have already agreed with partners to publish your patient's private data. also next week we will send out a press release for companies involved in the field of computer security. but you still have time....... gang: support: https: continews.best [redacted] gang: support: ...this is just the beginning... gang: support: did everyone in [redacted] receive email from us toady? gang: support: we gave you 3 days to respond. tomorrow is the last day. gang: support: can you give us your valid email address? we are going to close this chat and we need to put you in a copy when we send out a press release about [redacted]. gang: support: https: continews.best [redacted] gang: support: https: www.databreaches.net [redacted] gang: support: we are going to post the log of this chat. do you agree?

as per our rules, i will need to make an announcement regarding the publication of your data on our blog tomorrow if negotiations continue to drag on. victim: what negotiatons? i asked what you want and all you say is money. i'm not sure what i'm missing or should do at this point. i am waiting for you to tell me what you want. gang: attachment sent: 2023 form 990 for mastery schools.pdf 583 kb gang: do you know this document? gang: usually, for a company of your size, the amount is 2,000,000. but since you are filing tax reports on form 990, we are ready to reduce it to 950,000. this way you can hide it in the reports and keep the whole incident a secret. victim: i know you have my files. you already proved this. what do you want? gang: 950 000 victim: we are talking through everything and trying to process next steps. can you confirm for us what we would get if we were to pay you? gang: read the f.a.q., there are answers. more specifically, we will not publish your files we will delete them you will also receive a decryption program. victim: we are meeting next week with finance to see how much we can pay. i'll be back after the weekend. thanks gang: okay, i get you. i will turn off the timer until friday next week, to facilitate negotiations. can you name a day when you will have an answer? victim: we are meeting about this now and we simply don't understand why you are asking for so much. your price is just so high that we honestly don't see anything we can do on our end. we know you have all of our files and know exactly how much money we have, but why ask for more money than you know we have? paying you seems impossible at such a high amount. gang: earlier, i sent you the file with your tax records. these are the official documents that you submitted to the tax authorities. they show the amounts of your income and expenses. is the information you submitted to the tax service unreliable? victim: we are a public school. our income isn't normal income like a company. we don't generate revenue and don't have income. we operate on a strict and tight budget. gang: we have reviewed your documentation, not just the file you sent us above. the amount you are being offered is significantly lower than what a commercial organization would receive. victim: for that, we are appreciative. i don't mean to be disrespectful or unappreciative, but we just don't have the budget for a massive expense like this. you have all of our documents and can see this. our athletic department doesn't even have the funds to travel to away sporting events so they are trying to raise funds with bake sales and car washes. victim: listen, i don't want to waste your time. can you let me know the lowest amount you would be willing to accept so we can see if a payment is even possible? gang: i've given you the amount. now i expect the amount from you. we will discuss this and eventually come to some figure. it usually happens like this. and if we are not talking about deliberately small amounts, then negotiations can go very quickly, to our mutual satisfaction. victim: okay. we will review the budget and see how much funding we can allocate to this, but please be aware that it won't be much. we also would like to arrive at a mutual agreement. i'll be back gang: ok victim: we think we can pay something around 80,000 gang: it seems to me that you misspelled the amount there. forgot one digit in the number of 800,000 victim: no, not a typo. we can't offer what we don't have. anything you can do to make this work? gang: there is one option. you raise the amount to 2 btc exactly. now it's about 127,000. and you name the date by which you will pay, if we agree today. and i will try to explain to the management that despite the grants and sponsors, you don't have any more money and we can make such a deal. perhaps the management will agree. victim: we can't commit to anything before we take a closer look at our budget. this is a really large amount for us so we can't act on it instantly. can we get back to you by the end of the week? gang: the longer the negotiations take, the more difficult it will be for me to convince the management of this amount. but as i promised you, the timer is stopped until the end of the week. victim: thanks victim: good morning. we've been meeting and working on this for a few days now and the most we are able to afford to pay is still 80,000. we are a public school and simply don't have the budget for something like this. that said, we are trying to get an appointment to meet with the state education board to see about obtaining an emergency grant. due to the jewish holiday, we won't be able to get an appointment until after the weekend. i know you've been very patient with us so far, so all i ask right now is that you continue to remain patient so we can meet after the weekend to try to get the funds to pay you. is this okay? gang: on monday, will you tell me the result and the date when you will make the payment? victim: on monday, i hope to know when we'll be able to meet with the state boe. i'll let you know when we'll be able to meet with them. i know for any emergency funding requests, there's a vote that needs to take place and it could take a few days to be approved after the initial meeting. victim: my guess is we'll meet on tuesday or wednesday and hopefully by friday we should get approved, or at least have a good idea of when we'll be approved. gang: ok. i will be waiting for information from you. victim: thank you. i know the timing isn't ideal for either of us, but i appreciate your patience. victim: good morning, i have good news. we have an appointment to meet with the state board of education on wednesday. they are aware of the situation and that we will request emergency funding. after the meeting on wednesday, i will be back to let you know how it went. gang: ok, we will be waiting for information from you. victim: good news! we got an appointment to meet with the state boe to explain the situation and to request emergency funding. we will meet with them on friday afternoon. they said that they'll have to vote on the measure of the emergency funding request during their next closed-door session, which will happen on thursday, october 17th in the morning. once the voting is done, they will let us know right away and then i'll be back here to let you know. victim: i know that's not until next week, but we'll just have to be patient because they are the only ones who can help. in the meantime, can you please explain in detail how the payment process works? gang: you will need to pay btc to the wallet address given to you. to exchange usd for btc, you need to use any intermediary that suits you. we will only accept btc. victim: okay. we will start looking into that now. i'll be back after the vote next thursday, the 17th. once you have a bitcoin address for us to use, please provide it. gang: i can provide it right now. it has been added to the section for payment on your part. and the amount indicated is 2 btc. right now it's 123,660",2,-0.5,cold threat

gang: how much can you offer us, but please note that we cannot agree on 5,000. victim: 6000 ? how fast we can have the data back? we have already started the manual entries of invoices so until tomorrow i will have clear picture of what we have. also we are moving all our restored data to microsoft 365, eveyrhting seems to be ok apart from our 2 databases with missing data. i will know tomorrow how much work we need of manual entries. gang: 6,000 is still not enough. we cannot work with this amount. you need to offer more. victim: as i understand we cannot work together. so we will see what we can recover with manual work in the following days. your service would help me a lot save time if it is fast but you are very expensive for me. gang: after payment we will give you our avaddon decryptor, which will decrypt all your files on all your pcs and servers in a few hours. you can get back to work very quickly. victim: that is vey good news. but we cannot meet your price needs. gang: we want to help you and have made a big discount, but we cannot accept such a small amount. gang: you need to offer more so that we can work. victim: what about 8.5k ? gang: you give us amounts that we are not interested in at all, if you want to get a decryptor you need to offer a much higher amount victim: please give us a price we can pay so we can decide if we can move further. mention that we are not us, our office is in greece and we just opened after 3 lockdowns. if you cannot give us an amount we can pay we will just move forward. i really don't want to waste your time. gang: we understand the current situation and are ready to make concessions to you and charge a new price of 60,000 victim: the price range you give is unfortunately out of reach, i guess we will proceed without your service. thank you for your support. gang: what is the maximum amount you are willing to offer us? gang: guys ? victim: ok we are ready to pay 55k is it ok with you? victim: are you there? gang: ok gang: you need to send 1.44 btc to bitcoin address: [redacted] victim: i am unable to pay you ? is your bitcoin address correct? gang: [redacted] gang: this address is correct. victim: it's segwit address and due to that i believe i am getting the error gang: have you already figured out the problem? because the address is correct, the problem is on your part. victim: still facing issue gang: if you yourself cannot buy, then seek help from a specialist. because everything works from our side. victim: hi there, i want to know if you can give us a price we can pay so we can pay you. if we delay a lot discussing and chatting there is no interest from our side to buy your service. we already have setup most things in microsoft. our emails are ok, oru files were recovered from offline backups but we are missing 2 databases. these contain important data but we have hardcopies of invoices. our accountants started inputting theses invoices in the old database. we have two ways here. we can work manually and in a few weeks people will put all the invoices to our offline backups and . if you have doubts about data decryption, then on your landing page there is a test decryption section, upload an image file weighing up to 2mb and after a while you will receive a decrypted file. gang: guys, do you want us to give you the motivation to pay us? gang: :d gang: take it. we've stolen over 25gb of data from your network. what if i tell you the exact number of files? these are 50382 files! gang: if payment is not made within 24 hours, we will publish a post about the leakage of your data, make mass spam by emails of your competitors, clients, partners and tell them that all confidential data that they had associated with you was leaked through your fault. believe me, we know how much money will be spent on investigations and lawsuits. it will be much more than 55k. gang: do you need confirmation that we have the data? this is not a problem, we will provide them to you. just tell us to do it. gang: i hope you pay and i don t have to tell you what else we will do with your network in case of non-payment... gang: cooperating with us, we guarantee you complete confidentiality on our part, general decryptor with which you can restore absolutely all files on your pcs servers, a complete tree of the files we have taken from you and confirmation of their deletion after payment. we will also point out to you the vulnerabilities in your network and give recommendations on what to do to eliminate these vulnerabilities, following our security recommendations, you will be practically invisible to hacker attacks. gang: i think the choice is obvious. i changed the time for you to 24 hours, the time has gone. tick tock tick tock victim: sir we are not interested in your whole services. we cannot pay for it. can you recover for us 2 files? also we never told you that we can pay so high. we were willing to buy your service for 8.5k. please lets find a way to work in this range so it has some value to us. the amount you ask is unfortunately out of reach by far. gang: these are your words ok we are ready to pay 55k is it ok with you? victim: no sir. i didn't say that. we cannot find that money, not even close. although we could give you money for your service, because it will help us save time. this is 5 times more than we can afford. don't forget i told you that our office is in greece. not in the united states of america or germany. so we cannot afford your services. so if you don't help us pay, we cannot pay. gang: in the meaning, you didn't say that? check out our communication history above, you wrote it. victim: sir we cannot pay 55k. 5k yes we can pay instantly for your work. gang: we are not interested in this price. victim: ok victim: do you believe that 11000 will work for you? i just want to see if we can help each other come to an amount that 1 can be paid 2 can be found quickly by our side, because we could be able to find some money more but we need extra time, probably a 1-2 weeks to apply for some loan. but if we delay there is no meaning for us. just let me know because we need to decide during the weekend cause i need to inform our boss to take a decision. gang: 11,000 are not enough. gang: you need to offer more if you do not want us to publish your files. victim: the only thing we want from your service is to have our recent files back. if we agree on that and to the amount we can pay in 3-4 days because we need some days to gather 11.000 victim: its late here. i need to go to sleep. please decide soon if you accept so we can start finding the money. every day of manual work costs about 250 , we estimated that we need about 2 months to finish manual work with invoices and update our lost data. so if you give us good price, our boss will decide to pay you for faster results. gang: guys, you do not understand, you have a lot of problems. to restore the normal mode of operation, you need a lot of time and money. if you do not pay, then you are waiting for news in our blog, we will publish a lot of your files that you will not like. you will get damage to much more than 55,000. we offer you a solution to all these issues for an adequate price. gang: we have already made a big discount for you and are ready to work with you, but we are not satisfied with 11,000. gang: we are ready to make a small discount for you. victim: you constantly say other things. not interested. we just need 2 files and an amount we can pay. small discount cannot be paid. big discount from your side will be paid. just need those files faster. why you always say not satisfied? right now we can pay you 8000 , we can find another 3000-8000 by next week. but we cannot make money appear out of nothing. clients need to pay us for us to find the money. if you cannot work with this unfortunately we cannot afford your service. please help us pay you. gang: perhaps we can go down a little lower, but the price you offer absolutely does not suit us, we have already made you a big discount, if you do not go up then there will be no deal. victim: can we pay in installments like 5000 for 3 weeks? please help us purchase the service. we cannot pay with money we don't have. i am trying to figure out a way to work with you, but your demands still are 3 times more than we can afford to pay. gang: take a loan or find money in some other way, if your files are important to you, then you will find money. victim: our boss visited the bank this morning, loan will take about a week to reply to us. they cannot tell us yet if they can loan to us money. i will keep you updated. but we will need time. in the meantime let me know if we can find a way with less money so we can purchase part of your services. gang: you cannot pay for only 1 decrypted file, you either buy the general decryptor which will decrypt absolutely all your files or there will be no deal. gang: we will give you additional time to search for money, and we will not publish a publication about your data leak while you are looking for money. victim: i would like to know if we can reach an amount of 20k in 2 weeks so i can see if we can reach something like this after some time. because everyday we pay people to input old invoices. so if we find an amount we can meet your demands or there is no chance we can reach each other demands and convenience. gang: guys, look, we will give you the last price, 30k, this price is no longer discussed, either you pay exactly 30k or there will be no deal and we can say goodbye to you. victim: allow us 1 week to see if we can find the funds and when. gang: ok gang: done victim: hi victim: hello gang: hello, how can i help you? victim: we have found an employee that has monero. we will buy from him today and we can pay him in installments so we will pay today to save time. victim: please promise that when we pay you you will recover all our files and you will stop any bad actions to our network. also you will tell us how we will secure our network in the future. gang: after you make a payment, we guarantee the anonymity of the attack. we will not disseminate information about hacking your network, no one will know that your company was attacked. we will provide global decryption that will decipher all your files throughout your network. we also delete all your data and send you evidence of deletion. in addition, we guarantee you immunity from attacks on your company in the future. gang: when will you pay?

victim: why try another image? what will happen to these files that have double extention? will they be decrypted? victim: my most important files have 2 additional extensions and they are not accepted by test decryption. i am starting to worry about your service to be honest gang: this extension is not decrypt in test decryption. in test decryption, how can you see only files with certain extensions can be decrypted. do not worry, general decryptor will decrypt absolutely all files on your pcs and servers. victim: so you guarantee that all files, even files with double extention will be decrypted right? gang: of course, sir absolutely all files will be decrypted, there will be no problems with it, we promise you. victim: check the test decryption. i uploaded a file and it doesn't work. it doesn't open. gang: wait a bit gang: u can download your file [redacted].png victim: file cannot open try to open it and send me screenshot. gang: send us 1 image file and we will decrypt. use https: www.sendspace.com victim: ok. this is the file: https: www.sendspace.com file [redacted] gang: ok, we'll decrypt and send it to you. gang: archive: https: www.sendspace.com file [redacted] password: [redacted] gang: here is the decrypted file gang: we received 100 from you. you can send the rest. gang: you can download the decryptor on your payment page, update it. run the decryptor according to the instructions.",3,-0.53,pragmatic

gang: you entered the chat on nov 29th and still haven't made a single suggestion, it's not like you wish to resolve the issue quietly and quickly, you force us to publish your name, force us to call you and ddos. and then you ask for a discount? you are not the company that needs it and you have very little time left. you're a huge corporation with huge revenues, and the price is fair. if you resolve the issue quickly, we'll give you a discount, but you haven't earned it yet. gang: when will you pay?

victim: thank you for not deleting the decryptor and we were concerned it would be gone. we understand you want to get a deal done, but you encrypted our files at what was already a very difficult time. we had just recovered from another ransomware event with a different group. we had only barely gotten our systems running again. after dealing with that, we do not have much of anything left to offer you due to all of the costs associated with the first ransomware group. we want to purchase your decryptor and get back to business but we simply cannot due to the first attack. gang: apparently after the first attack you did not understand that it is necessary to monitor the security of systems. after payment, we will let you know how your network was penetrated, we will not attack you again and tell you what to do to prevent such cases again. the first group didn't give you any advice? victim: no, the first group did not give us any advice. and unfortunately, as we have said we can't pay the amount you are asking. if we could, we would gladly pay it. two of these attacks in very short order has left us very distraught and in a bad place. but we cannot give you what we don't have. we can still offer you the same amount we did before of 400,000 that we can pay in short order if you are willing to accept it. we just want to be done with this and get back to business as this has been extremely difficult for us. gang: no, it means that the first attack did not make you understand that you need to monitor and ensure the safety of your company, employees and reputation. you have to pay for all that. usually companies take care of this, pay good sysadmins, buy different programs and more, but in short ensure security. or pay for pentest services with post-pay, which is what we do, and we know the price of their services and their work. based on all this, the amount you offer is very small, and it is not enough to solve the problem. the price is 3,600,000. gang: well?

as 1b in sales. my client is an it service company, so do you have any information about the company my client provides? isn't it saying that sales are 1b? i'm also acting as an agent in the middle, so i don't know what they're discussing i don't know exactly what they re discussing, and they just say that they need more time gang: they're bluffing. gang: apparently the reputation of your company and the value of the stock on the stock exchange are of no value to your client since he is behaving this way. victim: what did we do? i don't know what you mean. victim: we are doing our best to negotiate in the middle. but the amount is so big that i don't know what to do with the customer. what we want is a price adjustment. victim: is there absolutely no room for negotiation? gang: we negotiate with you, but you do not make any offers, but only bluff, how can we negotiate with you? gang: your company's annual revenue is 10 billion, you're trying to lie to me that 18 million is a very large amount for you, it's not serious. victim: okay. i'll try to convince our client as soon as possible victim: my client is not lying. there's something you need to know exactly victim: the company you hacked is an it service company, and the information you have on the server is the customer s of my client information. victim: the 10b revenue you're talking about is the revenue of customers of my client . victim: you hacked my client s revenue was 70m and the profit was 4m last year. the client you hacked cannot afford to pay 18m. victim: so the client confessed to the customer and is discussing the hacking. this complicated process delays the answer. you should understand this situation victim: i think the hacked it service company will probably offer around 500,000 at the outset gang: the fact that we hacked your client's company through the it company that serviced him does not mean that the ransom price should be less, your it company is not interesting to us, we need the big fish, your client. victim: i fully understand that you need big fish. victim: big fish is very angry with it service company. because it service company was hacked and big fish s information was leaked, big fish is saying that it company should pay for everything. also if this doesn't be solved, i heard that big fish will cut the deal with the it company and fill a damage compensation lawsuit. victim: i will explain again because you still don't seem to understand the current situation clearly. my client is an it service company. you hacked through this it service company and had big fish's information. victim: i will explain again because you still don't seem to understand the current situation clearly. my client is an it service company. you hacked through this it service company and had big fish's information. victim: however, it service company cannot afford to pay 18m, as i said before. in the previous conversation, i said that it service company would pay 500,000. bur now it service company seem willing to pay up to 1,000,000 for resolution. and that's big amount one-third of the client's one-year profit victim: please understand the above situation accurately and give me an answer. gang: i understand that your job as a negotiator is to get the ransom price as low as possible, you are a good negotiator, but in this case you are offering too small an amount for a very large company, the damage we can do to your client is absolutely incomparable to the amount you are offering. it doesn't matter who wins your lawsuit, we are now talking about saving a lot more in lost profits for your client, your client would be much better off paying us the ransom and then suing the it company and recovering the damages. the company's stock could collapse so badly that your client would lose hundreds of millions of dollars instead of just 18 million. i appreciate the increase in buyout amount from your side and see it as a desire to make a good deal for both of us, but 1 million is absolutely not enough for a company with annual revenues of 10 billion dollars. at the same time to show respect to you as a brilliant negotiator i am ready to make a discount of 3 million dollars, in this way i am ready to completely remove all your stolen data, provide decryption keys, and forget about the fact that you have ever been attacked, our deal will be an absolute secret and no one will ever know about it. it's up to you. gang: the bottom line is that if you pay me 15 million dollars in 3 days, everyone will be happy. victim: with this level of hacking skills, you must be very smart and logical people. it seems that we need logical conversations, not emotional ones. victim: i understand that you reasonably present the required amount depending on the size of the company's revenue bigfish's revenue is about 2b, not 10b and big fish's profit is much less than this. the amount you ask for is a very difficult amount to pay for even big fish. if you need to check big fish's sales and profits, you can check it right away by entering the stock site. if necessary, i will send financial statements disclosed on the securities site victim: i think negotiations can proceed only when the required amount is presented again. i look forward to a positive answer. gang: i am not emotional. i would be happy to see financial documents that you can show me. victim: i can't contact you because it's the weekend now. i will contact you on monday. gang: ok victim: i send you the sales volume of the big fish that i checked directly on the google securities site. victim: in terms of , last year's sales volume is about 1.8b. the reason why you check the exact sales volume of big fish is because i think it's to reasonably adjust the required amount. victim: file: [ .png] gang: where net profit? victim: net income last year was about 30m on a basis. and as you know, this year is worse because of the global economic downturn.

checking this info victim: okay. please check and adjust the price. gang: you're doing insider trading, so i can't give you a discount, it's a criminal offense for your management. gang: as a person who earns not entirely by legal means, i am sympathetic to the desire to make money, so i'm ready to keep this secret between us if you will not be greedy and give me 15 million. gang: also, you are bluffing by understating your net income, your net income in march was 16 million and that is only one month, your stock is up 8 today, your business is booming, i think you should not be greedy, and be reasonable by making a deal with me. victim: the article was deleted again what should i do? gang: what you mean? send screenshot please gang: i not understand you gang: login in victim chat in 1 window gang: if you open 1 id in two browser you may have problem victim: what does insider trading mean? do you mean i cheat to take a lot of fees between you and big fish? victim: the post will continue to be deleted. can i move the address of the site address? victim: let's continue the conversation here http: lockbitsupuhswh4izvoucoxsbnotkmgq6durg7kficg6u33zfvq3oyd.onion victim: let's continue the conversation here http: lockbitsupuhswh4izvoucoxsbnotkmgq6durg7kficg6u33zfvq3oyd.onion gang: ok gang: i fix bug with chat, press f5 and you will see all message victim: ok check victim: what does insider trading mean? do you mean i cheat to take a lot of fees between you and big fish? gang: insider trading means that big fish are breaking the law and making money by dumping and dumping their stock on the exchange. gang: your time to decide is coming to an end, we are beginning preparations to publish your 2 terabytes of corporate data on our blogs. gang: http: lockbit7z2jwcskxpbokpemdxmltipntwlkmidcll2qirbu7ykg46eyd.onion gang: the correspondence between us will be as published as in this example. gang: http: lockbitapt2d73krlbewgv27tquljgxr33xbwwsp6rkyieto7u4ncead.onion post l107zta4uccnfdp562d695f5bdbf0 gang: also, you should know that after all of your information is published, the price of redemption will double and will be 30 million dollars. victim: first of all, i am never lying about the financial figures of big fish. and big fish says there is no problem with insider trading legally. victim: big fish think that 10b in sales 15m in payments. if the actual sales amount was 2b, it was naturally thought that negotiations would begin at a much lower amount. but you keep saying the same amount. and, my client has information on how much other companies with similar sales paid. although i said the financial situation of the it service company that has to pay the money actually and big fish's situation several times but you're asking for the same amount. victim: my client raised the payment to 1m -- 2m. gang: other companies paid a lot more than you, the thing is that all reasonable companies always pay quietly and quickly and no one knows about what they paid, because our deal is kept absolutely secret, with a successful transaction absolutely all traces of negotiations and all company data is removed, no one can know about the real amounts of payments companies except me, for example recently the company from nasdaq paid 70 million dollars and its annual turnover was only 6 billion dollars, so each company is unique and the amount of the ransom is assigned depending on the value of the data we possess. gang: in this case, your client's company earns more than 15 million in net profit every month, victims share information among themselves. big fish says the amount is too much because big fish heard there. victim: and, you keep talking about internal trading issues. big fish says he doesn't know why you're talking about internal trading. big fish wants you to give him more solid evidence that you have relevant information victim: and you said that the amount is determined by the value of the data you have. i don't know exactly what data you have revealing only a few to us , but i think you're overestimating it. there is too much difference between the value of data you think and the value of data that big fish thinks. this is the most important factor for you and big fish to talk about the price victim: and i think you researched the public source. the profit you're talking about is quarterly profit three months , not one month. gang: 13.500.000 is the best we can do for you. gang: if your company's reputation isn't worth the money, we can't do the deal. victim: i'll deliver it to the customer. it's dinner time after work, so i think i'll contact you tomorrow morning gang: https: www.bleepingcomputer.com news security lockbit-victim-estimates-cost-of-ransomware-attack-to-be-42-million gang: i think this article will help your client think with his head better. atento was also very greedy, ended up paying many times more only not to us anymore. victim: after you sent 13.5m it is such an important decision that executives in the big fish are discussing it the amount itself is too big, and there are different opinions on how to pay that large amount. i will reply as soon as my client reach a conclusion. gang: companies regularly pay us amounts and more, nothing unusual. victim: overseas remittance through btc exchange has become a big issue in korea it has been expanded to the prosecution's investigation, and the entire coin transaction is being investigated. link: www.seoul.co.kr news newsview.php?id 20220815015003 wlog tag3 victim: so it's hard to transfer a large amount at once a small amount of money should be remitted first and the status should be watched to see if the prosecution notices. victim: we will now discuss how to trade. because i need to make sure it's restored the entire remittance is difficult and will be traded little by little. i want to make a recovery transaction for 3 servers each. how much does it cost to recover three servers each? we should pay attention not only to data leakage but also to the prosecution's surveillance. gang: there is no technical possibility to decrypt only 3 servers, your company is encrypted with one key, if i give you a decryptor, then you decrypt absolutely all the computers in the network. gang: if you want to make a transaction between us, you will find the opportunity to buy cryptocurrency. a lot of individuals sell cryptocurrency, you can buy cryptocurrency for cash including, korea is famous for its cryptomillionaires. if you want to make a transaction between us, you will find the opportunity to buy cryptocurrency. so many individuals sell cryptocurrency, you can buy cryptocurrency for cash including, korea is famous for its crypto millionaires. various companies around the world including even third world countries somehow managed to buy cryptocurrency, and you living in a country where every person has 3 higher education, in a country where the total mass of the population is the smartest people, can't handle it? i don't believe in such a thing? gang: no one can ever forbid the director of your company to buy any amount of cryptocurrency with his personal earned money. in addition, you can use the anonymous cryptocurrency monero, transactions in this currency are not tracked in the blockchain and your prosecutor's office will never know anything. gang: the prosecutor's office will be much happier studying 2 terabytes of your data than some cryptocurrency transactions on the internet. victim: i know that each server has an id value. so i also know that split transactions are possible. you must verify that data recovery is possible on the server. we have to show the restored one to the customer. you should gain credibility by showing that it has been restored. so i want a split deal. 13,500,000 is a huge amount. it is difficult for customers to remit money at once, and they can remit money while watching data recovery. please tell me how to do the split transaction gang: you are mistaken. gang: id consists of 32 characters, the first 16 characters is part of the public key that encrypts your data, the second part consists of the second 16 characters is a random set of data that has nothing to do with encryption keys, the second 16 characters are needed to ensure that no one can get into our chat, so we achieve a private conversation. gang: if you are not sure if the decryptor works, you can collect 10-20 files from different computers, i will decrypt them for free. gang: but you will receive the universal decryptor only after paying the full amount. gang: if you are afraid to transfer the whole amount you can split it into several payments, for example make 7 payments to different wallets of 2 million dollars. gang: payment can be made within a week, 1 day - 2 million, so you can pay less noticeably for your favorite procrustean. victim: will you restore the db to the test? it is important to see that data is recovered one by one. victim: if it is not 3 pieces, i want to recover 5 pieces per id. gang: i don't understand you. gang: do you want to restore some very valuable file such as a database for a test? it is not possible. you can collect from the whole company not very valuable documents which are of no particular value, moreover after decrypting these files i will check their contents that they are of no value and only after that i will give them to you. victim: can't we split it up and recover it little by little? gang: of course not, then you would have no desire to pay the full amount, you are trying to deceive me and decipher the most important data victim: i want you to give me a suggestion. is it possible to trade 500,000 at a time? victim: we have 2tb of data. if we don't keep our promise, i know you'll reopen and gossip about the data. if you spread the rumor, we will lose a lot of money due to stock price fluctuations. i need 2tb. don't spread the word therefore, we will do our best to keep our promise. 1. don't spread it. 2. delete 2tb after completion of transaction. 3. i request restoration little by little by little. gang: yes, i don't mind going out of my way to help you keep our deal a secret from the police and prosecutors, they are always sticking their noses where they don't need to and want to collect more taxes. moreover, you can divide the amount into any numbers, not necessarily an even value of 500 thousand or 1 million or 2 million, you can use a random number generator and make many random payments to many purses, for example to 1 purse you can send 563 thousand dollars, to 2 purse 435 thousand dollars, as convenient and safe for you. gang: you can be absolutely sure that your data is safe, all data will be destroyed, no one will ever know about our attack on you and that we had a deal, after i provide you with proof of removal of all your information and you decrypt all your data we will delete this chat room and you will continue to prosper and make hundreds of millions of dollars. gang: you are very lucky that you were attacked by us, we are the largest faction in the world and always take responsibility for their words, for us reputation is as important as for you. if we ever cheated even one person, no one would pay us in the future. victim: then, how much do i have to tell you so that i can trade little by little? gang: i don't understand you. gang: paraphrase, tell me more about what you want. victim: i want a recovery request by partitioning. gang: i told you that's not possible because then you wouldn't pay the full amount, you would decrypt critical files for you. gang: i can demonstrate that the decryptor works on a few dozen files taken from any computer in your network, this is enough to know that the decryptor works successfully. victim: we have 2tb of data. we need restoration and want to erase your data. so i'll close the deal. please tell me how i can recover the data in installments. gang: we can remove data in installments, decryptor for the whole network only after paying the full amount. victim: i know. we will continue the recovery process to the end. i want to delete the data you have. but the customer can't believe it's working properly. you guys need to recover little by little. you have to pay little by little and recover normally to make an additional deposit. gang: no need to cheat, all files on the network are encrypted with the same locker, all of them are decrypted equally successfully. gang: if your client feels more comfortable, we can encrypt the test bench and then decrypt it in front of him. gang: prepare your computer for the encryption and decryption test, i will give you two programs, one which encrypts and one which decrypts. your client will make sure that everything works successfully and with peace of mind will pay us. gang: file: [encryptor.exe.7z] gang: encrypt any pc of your client or virtual machine, then write to new chat with new id from test pc and i give you free decryptor for this pc gang: in this way your client will make sure that the decoder works and that there are no problems. victim: it doesn't matter that you can infect and treat it. it is important to restore our infected data to normal. and it is important to delete the data you have. gang: yes, this will be done after payment. victim: you need to recover one id each. gang: do i look like a fool who will give you a decryptor for backups? stop this cycr. victim: what is a backup for decryptor? are you saying that we can't recover by division? gang: i mean, i don't have a decryptor for the 1st id, either all id or nothing. gang: you can check this on a test computer, encrypt several computers, i will give you a decryptor for 1 computer but with it you can decrypt all computers. gang: your time is running out, we are starting to upload your data to the blog for publication. gang: if you want to stop publishing, make a payment of 13,500,000 to this bitcoin wallet bc1qnhgmuz5kdjn5rqjhayn9n8e8lvumjjpnnjdczz victim: with the program you sent me, i organized an environment for encryption and

victim: our leadership team is still reviewing the file listings, this is going to take us a couple of days. one question that keeps being asked is, do the file listings you provided include all of the data you took? gang: you see the timer. nobody going to wait for you to check every single file from the list. stay slow and everybody will check the listing with you. also we have prepared special high speed mirrors for press. victim: yesterday the timer showed 4 extra days. our leadership team planned on using that time to review the data so that we can prepare a counteroffer. we are still evaluating the data and need to work through this process. if you post the data, then we have no reason to give you an offer. please return the timer as it was so we can continue our discussions to come to a resolution on this. gang: you have 48 hours victim: we ve had a chance to perform our review, we want to make sure we re very transparent with you as we work together to resolve this. victim: based on what we have seen in the list, we are going to have to notify a lot of our clients of this by law. this will cost us a lot of money to do regardless of whether we pay you or not, so we have to account for that. we d still be willing to pay you so that the data gets deleted, but that price has to be realistic. 15m is not realistic for us. victim: considering what we have available and what we need to spend regardless, we re willing to pay 500,000 to resolve this with you. gang: you can pay 15m and nobody will know about what data we have. i don't want to see amounts like 500k or 1-2-3-m because its ridiculous for your company size and you'll pay much more if i post your data. gang: i had a conversation with my boss. due to our rules we cannot review any unreasonable offers. my boss is provide you a discount so now you can pay 14.5m. next week it will be 30m . if you think that it's too much say it now. consider your responsibility for the clients. victim: the size of our company doesn t matter in this situation, and if you know our finances, then you know we haven t made a profit in years. what matters is what we can pay and what is realistic for us. based on what you have shown us and what we have to pay regardless because of our legal obligations, what is realistic for us is 750,000, maybe a little bit more based on what you have shown us. perhaps you discuss with your boss again to explain the situation and extend the timer while we continue discussing the resolution of this with you. gang: we do know about your financial situation and we know that you can pay. but i can trust you and provide access to your data for everyone or press only. so may i count on you and wait a little bit more or you going to put me bullshit offers everyday? victim: if you make our data public then we have not reason to keep negotiating or make a payment of any amount. the price you are asking is completely beyond our capability to pay and we ask that you re-consider our last offer or provide a number that's more reasonable. either way, we need more time to figure this all out. gang: i wont talk with my boss about all offers under 8m . if you swear me to give me normal offer i can give you extra time. victim: we will go back to our leadership team and board to discuss what we can do. please give us more time, it is going to take us some time to get the appropriate individuals engaged. gang: timer is paused until tomorrow. i warn you to stop playing this games with us because our patience is almost done. victim: we can bring our offer up to 1,000,000 but this will deplete what funds what we currently have available for a payment. gang: read one more time carefully my previous messages. i told you that i don't want to see offers like this. i'm starting to make first steps to destroy your company because you don't want to make a deal with me. you think i'm fool? i have your files and i know how much money you have. gang: ceo of sirva knows about this shit offers? he understand how much funds he will loose in all departments around the world after work we'll done? victim: our offer was approved by the leadership team and board, these are the individuals who determined that 1,000,000 is a reasonable and realistic valuation. your attempt to reach out to or call our people will not influence our position. 1,000,000 is all that we are able to offer at this time and we would like to ask you to review this offer with your boss. gang: we don't accept your offer. we've been waiting long time for a good offer from you and can't wait anymore. now we will start working with media by sending them a links with all data of your clients, transactions, taxes, etc. we have collected a lot of data and we will send a it to the tax department, trade unions and more law offices later. we think they will be interested in your activities. we don't want to have a dialogue with you because you're losing our time. wish you the best luck. victim: we have been working in good faith with you to bring this to a realistic resolution. if you move forward and publish or make public any more of our data than we will have no incentive to work with you. we have to believe that 1,000,000 is worth more to you than publishing our information. if you can provide us a more realistic price than we can discuss this in our next leadership meeting that is scheduled for monday. victim: we see that you have re-posted some files. we previously indicated that disclosure of information impacts our incentive to pay. victim: we have demonstrated a willingness to pay a realistic amount but you continue to demand an amount that is higher than we can pay, make unnecessary threats and are taking these unnecessary posting actions that cannot change our position. we have told you that we need until monday to discuss any increased payment. we ask you remove the files, stop your threats and accept a reasonable offer from us. gang: i told you, next step is calling all you clients. i told that if you don't want to pay us you'll lose more. stop your shit talk about you don't have funds and so on. i know who you are and what work you need to do and you know that if i'll publish all data from sirva company you'll get nothing. so you need to talk with sirva company management and come back with amount which we're asking. victim: we ve been very transparent with you throughout this process. as we said, if you make any additional disclosures of our information, our willingness to pay any amount will be drastically reduced. republishing our name and original data on the site and continuing to try to contact our leadership or media won t change our position, and in fact will make us less willing to pay. we are willing to pay a realistic price and come to an agreement with you. 1,000,000 is that price. let s close this and both move on with a win. gang: it could be win for you not for us. seems you don't want to make a deal. gang: http: lockbit7z2jwcskxpbokpemdxmltipntwlkmidcll2qirbu7ykg46eyd.onion secret acc2cf6896c0c9c116ff8c52bda40d0b sirva.com gang: you have 2 days until it will be published. all or nothing. gang: file: [all.jpg] gang: here you go. the day after tomorrow, i will send another letter with all your data victim: your continued pressure and threats make it very clear to us that you want to get paid and close this deal. the amount of money you are asking is nowhere near a realistic price to pay for the data you have shown us. we have said this time and time again. your new threat to notify the media and your continued efforts to threaten our business, our leadership and our customers will not change our valuation of the data and will not influence our position. we have clearly demonstrated the price range we are able to work within. stop playing your games, wasting our time and let s close this business deal. give us a price within range of our offer and our leadership team will discuss making a deal. gang: the price range is between 7,7 and 15 million dollars, i already told you that, did you forget? victim: we saw that you originally responded and asked 'what range?' it looks like you have now changed that response which is unfortunate. you should realize by now, the realistic range we are willing to consider is evident by our offer to date. take this information back to your boss and let s discuss a price that is more realistic. gang: hello, this is boss lockbit, my partner asked if he can make an additional discount and agree to your miserable pennies, i refused him. the thing is that since october 1, according to the new rules it is strictly forbidden to make a discount of more than 50 of the originally announced redemption amount, so the partner has no right to make a discount on a single dollar even if he wants it very much and believed in your funny fairy tales about your poverty and the last possible price for you 7.500.000. i as the boss will be very happy to see your information on my blog, your information will be kept there forever. the only way to prevent the leak is to accept my last possible price, otherwise you will not only suffer losses from the leak but will be repeatedly attacked again in the future and will not know in what original way your very profitable and successful company was hacked until now. all the best, you can continue negotiations with my partner. victim: i have no way of knowing if the individual who wrote this last message is truly a different person. everything about this message tells us that you are still interested in making a deal and getting paid. your original price is unweighted and not realistic. your internal rules about the discount percentage you are able to provide do not apply to us or this situation. that is unfortunately an issue you are going to need to work through internally, come back to us with a resolution if you would like to make this deal. we reiterate, if you publish our data we are done. your demand is totally out of our range and as a result we will not provide another counteroffer until you give us a more realistic price within our range. gang: work on the leak. correspondence will be attached to the blog post. victim: we will need to meet with the leadership team tomorrow gang: no. you still have 9 hours. victim: we will not be able to get approvals to raise our offer tonight. you are going to need to wait until tomorrow. gang: no. you already had a lot of time which you wasted so hurry up.",6,-0.22,hostile

something tells me that you are bluffing and you are doing system recovery and want to get free decryption of critical files needed for recovery. tell me in detail what the medical equipment is and what the 6 gigabyte files are. victim: there are 2 files that are a combined 6 gigabytes when compressed. you know how much of our data is encrypted and when you see the files, you will understand that they will not allow us to recover. we are only pressing this because of the medical concern and we do not believe that your intent is to hurt anyone. gang: what are these files? what is their function? what medical equipment are these files for? and what does the postal service have to do with medical software? where is the logic? victim: we are not just a postal service. we handle both letters and parcels, where roughly 60 of our business is parcels - international export of global medical supplies, contribute to a significant element of that! these supplies include vital replacement equipment parts, covid-19 test kits, prescription drugs etc. the files that we have provided should allow us to resume shipping some of this equipment, not only here in the uk, but globally as well. our transportation of this medical equipment does play a vital role in ensuring that people in need are being helped by these products. given that the files are renamed, we are making our best assumption that this is the right dataset, and we would greatly appreciate the assistance. gang: if you pretend that you do not believe that the decryptor really works, you can send me 10-20 other less important files, e.g. not related to virtualization systems and not containing ram dumps, you can send me personal documents, photos, and many other things that do not help you without paying for my postpaid pentest services. if you were really worried about medical equipment, just pay for my work and get a decryptor within 5 minutes. you are making multi-billion dollar profits from your business and don't want to part with the money, don't you think that's odd? it's your greed that makes the people who are waiting for their packages suffer. victim: we are not pretending anything and apologise if it appears that way. it is just that my management have heard that your decryptor might not work on large files, that is why they asked and wanted to see if it did. i am trying to convince them to work with you here, they are just asking for more proof of what we will get from you. as you probably know, we are already a loss making company, so we are not gaining anything from dragging this out. there are several articles on google about our financial situation and how bad it is currently. gang: you can send me other large files, i will decrypt for you those files that i think are not valuable, that way you can be sure that the decryptor works on large files. your financial situation is fine, you have a multi-billion dollar turnover, and a huge profit, the sooner you pay, the sooner this whole nightmare will be over for you. if you continue to stretch time i will be forced to publish your information on the blog with an offer to change negotiators, thank you for your understanding. victim: we are collecting some larger files that are not valuable to provide you. it's important for us to understand these can be decrypted of course so we appreciate you providing that opportunity to us. ahead of this, we haven't even heard from you what it is that you want. gang: i'm waiting for the next batch of files to be decrypted. we want as 0.5 of your revenue. victim: and how much is that?

even if they were to fine us, paying you or not does not change this. victim: we'll get you the files and we can continue these talks later. gang: as long as we haven't published any of your files, you can't be fined. if you can negotiate with us, the government will be left without your 640 million. it is much better for you to negotiate with us and continue your very successful business with a long history and impeccable reputation. i personally used the services of your company and was very satisfied. i wouldn't want you to suffer so much from the government. victim: talk to you later gang: ok victim: how do i give you these large files? they are larger than your 2gb limit gang: my internet does not allow me to download such huge files, my internet speed is 50 kilobytes per second, send me files up to 50-100 megabytes at most. at the same time i can offer you to do the following, i will create a build of the encryptor and give you together with the decryptor, you will encrypt any files on your virtual machine and this way you can check the successful decryption of files larger than 2 gigabytes. victim: okay, i guess we can try that. we just want to have confidence your decryption tool will work on these large files gang: you don't have to worry, thousands of people have successfully decrypted their files for almost four years. victim: i believe you, but we need to see it ourselves before we can consider this gang: http: lockbitfile2tcudkcqqt2ve6btssyvqwlizbpv5vz337lslmhff2uad.onion r 8oqc8jkabn 1ee8ymfqprjd5q9wrppejtepdhwweuh1ohhx lm6cam gang: encrypt any of your computers or virtual machines, any amount or amount of information. write to me via a note and i will give you a decryptor in a new chat in which you will write to me. gang: to start the encryption, simply run the file as administrator. victim: there is still some confusion over who we are, you are basing your revenue on what is a holding company and not royal mail group. ids international distribution services have several companies that exist under that umbrella who are independent to each other. we are royal mail international who is a separate entity, with an entirely independent managing director and senior official. our company s revenue is in decline, as we have tried to explain to you previously and royal mail international is the company that is affected by your penetration testing. our current financial turnover is expected to be 800 million. based on your calculation for payment 0.5 of total revenue this equals 4 million dollars. if there is any negotiation at this percentage level the starting figure needs to represent what i have just described. i am trying to help our senior team understand this and i am grateful that you have offered to help them see that your decryptor can work to restore our services, by offering to decrypt some larger files. we will have to accept what we have for now and will see if this is good enough for them or not.. gang: you're bluffing, 800 million is your net profit per year, so 80 million is not that much money for you. victim: what company are you looking at to get those numbers?

the price is based on a multi-billion dollar company's profits, it's not the case that a company making billions of dollars pays the same price as an ordinary company making tens of millions of dollars. the more profits a company makes, the higher the buyout price, that's the math, you and your board of directors should understand that. out of respect for you, i'm willing to step up and give you a 12.5 discount. victim: thank you for this. i appreciate you coming forward like this. i will bring this to my management and get back to you. gang: ok. victim: i just want to let you know, that i am still waiting for a reply. my manager told me, that he is waiting to hear back from the board. he has promised me i ll get an answer on monday. i will let you know as soon as i hear anything. gang: very long, the company from the uk paid on the second day after the attack because they care more about their business and reputation, strange that for you it is not so important, because you make a lot more money. victim: maybe you didn't ask them for such a large amount. that would probably make it easier to pay quickly. my manager hasn't gotten an update from the board yet, can i check back in with you monday? gang: naturally, i asked them for a smaller amount, their revenue is 58 times less than yours, they earn money 58 times less than you, i always ask for a fair and adequate amount from each company, i do not ask for what the company can not pay. why do you have such a long chain of middlemen? why can't you communicate directly with the director? i will wait until monday, but i think it is time to end this case. the journalists are asking me why i haven't published your information while i ignore their questions, they really want to see your files. gang: you need pay. gang: http: lockbitapt2d73krlbewgv27tquljgxr33xbwwsp6rkyieto7u4ncead.onion post tqvytkkoycawsxyg63e0f8ce66113 gang: you have 50 hours for payment. victim: i just want to let you know, that i am still waiting to hear back from my management. it is not a quick decision for them, and i can t just tell the board to hurry up. to be honest with you i have heard that they might not want to pay you for this. in our perspective the files got leaked when you took them from our system, and paying you won t undo that in any way. i will get back to you as soon as i have further news. gang: i just want to let you know that the data is ready to be published and the decryptor is ready to be deleted. you have had plenty of time to make your decision, your time is up. gang: do you have any offer for me?",3,-0.5,pragmatic

brilliant blog, you can also see how greedy people can be and how much money they lose by refusing to pay a relatively small amount of their income gang: http:

match our business or what we can pay. give us a realistic amount and we can settle this quickly. gang: give us a realistic amount and we can settle this quickly. victim: the onion link is not work

amount. if you looked at zoominfo, you would realize we are mispriced. we are ready to transfer you 50k victim: we are ready to solve this now. gang: it's not enough. victim: give me a number to work with then. gang: 6m victim: do you understand me, obviously not. you are asking for 30 times net income. our total revenue is below 10kk. look at zoominfo. victim: you have us confused with some other firm victim: as i have told you, we are willing to settle as quickly as possible if you give us a realistic number gang: tapcocu.org? victim: yes. gang: 6m gang: total revenues 19,621,065 2019 yearly

site. victim: are you not understanding financials. let me help you out victim: you have 2019 numbers, not 2022. also revenues- expenses with the numbers you have listed, which are not correct are only equate to under 1m. are you telling me you normally ask a company to pay 6m on under 10m in revenue with net income a little over 200k. i have no idea how any company would pay you. gang: are you saying that the net profit per year is 200,000? victim: after you take out all the ebitda and expenses, yes. look. we want to work with you but what you ask is impossible to give. give me a workable number and we will come to terms gang: i don't believe you make 200,000 a year, that's a lie. victim: why does you site say socket connection issue gang: its normal gang: we in tor and under ddos 24 7 365 victim: you are under ddos by who victim: ok. know i understand why socket connection issue. gang: we attack hundreds of companies like you, there are many who don't like us victim: i understand. well, we are not attacking you. we just want to get to a solution and move about business gang: ok no problem, transfer me 6 million and we'll make a deal right now, everyone will be happy. victim: i am really trying to explain it. we do not have what you want. you are asking for 60 of revenue. you really extort companies for 60 of revenue. so you would charge a company that has 200million of revenue 120million ransom. gang: total assets 394,852,832 victim: you are working with bad information on us. so either reprice us and come to something reasonable or we are not going to have much to chat about victim: that is not our money. i am sure you have a bank account somewhere. the bank cannot give your money to someone else gang: what kind of reasonable price can we talk about if you lie to me in every word? victim: why would lie to you. i just want to get to a solution and then move to fixing our network. gang: since you are a credit organization because of our attack all your clients will stop trusting you, your business will be destroyed, this is what our pricing policy is related to, each company has an individual approach, you can never agree with me for 50 thousand dollars, if you have no more money do not write me anymore. victim: if you give me something to work with, i can see what i can do here gang: ask something of the director of your credit organization, whether he wants to preserve the reputation of his company or whether he better start thinking about creating a new company. gang: thanks for the dialogue, i have 3 prostitutes coming to see me, i have to leave you. have a good day. victim: well, enjoy then. when you return, can we get to a solution. victim: we want to get to a deal as quickly as possible. after discussions with the board and reviewing our financials, we are looking to increase our offer to be between 250k to 400k. we want to settle today so hopefully you can understand our position and we can close this deal. for the amount within the range, we would like the decryption software, support for it, you said you had data of ours so we would like a listing of the documents and some type of deletion log to prove you no longer have it, explain how you got into our network, and to never attack us again. we look forward to your positive response. gang: this is still not a sufficient amount, you are being brazen and clearly misleading me, but i take into account your step to meet and am also ready to give you a discount of up to 5.500.000. victim: not trying to be brazen nor misleading you. i am trying to provide the facts to you that your demand amount is not realistic for a company our size and if you would work with us, we would settle this todayh gang: if you had stopped lying to me and wanted to save your business then you would have stopped the ddos attack and decrypted your network in 5 minutes. victim: i want to decrypt our network as quickly as possible and want to do a deal. your starting number is not manageable for a company of 100 employees. if your number would have been in the 250k to 400k range, we would have paid you right away. victim: so let's talk about paying you right away. can we get a reasonable number so you can go enjoy your weekend gang: in connection with a ddos attack you try to change the source code of your website and the entire authorization page including post data, this will not help you, you open new vulnerabilities that will allow other hackers to easily download all the data from your website, thus you only make yourself worse, once your customers' data is published you can forget about your business, no one will ever trust you. stop, don't make a stupid step, your assets are more than 300 million dollars, your director will not get poorer if he pays me 5.500.000. do not be greedy, save your priceless reputation and business, in banking there is nothing more valuable than a reputation, your reputation you have earned over many years and lose in an instant. victim: can you proivde the partial file tree while i caucus with my board members gang: it will take some time, yes i can do it if you are willing to wait. victim: as a credit union, we are a not for profit and the number your reference in not our money. we hold money for indivuduals in their accounts in their name. we cannot use this money. gang: then let this organization know that it's time to take your money, your time is up. gang: the best i can do for you is 5 million gang: voice your decision, it's time to publish your data. victim: i don't know what you mean by our time is up but we are negotiating in good faith. our board is willing increase it's offer range to 650k - 750k which we can pay quickly. publishing our data does no good. we are here trying to resolve this. you think we have more money than we have and we have asked you to consider we are a not for profit credit union and the assets you reference are not ours. gang: tell your board that the price will not go below 5 million, please give me their answer as soon as possible. gang: i also negotiate in good faith, but i can't do it forever; my time is very expensive. when i see that negotiations are deadlocked and you do not hear me, there is no point in continuing negotiations. we are not in the arab market to bargain here for 100-200 thousand dollars. you and i have serious businesses, we earn millions of dollars, the reputation of your business is priceless and can not be worth less than 5 million, if your leadership is adequate and understands that the business had to close, they will pay 5 million, if you are willing to close your business, enjoy your 5 million and do not pay me. victim: we are under 100 person firm. the assets you reference are not ours. if you are financially motivated we have given you a reasonable offer and most victims on your blog have amounts fall smaller than the amount you want and are larger organizations. gang: the amount of ransom is always individual and depends on different factors, annual income, profit, quality of network encryption, quantity of stolen data, quality of stolen data, availability of dirt, violations of the law and more. in my blog there is no credit organization that gives loans to people, what do you think is the reason for this? gang: i'm going for a boat ride soon, if you want to close the deal right now let me know back soon. thank you. victim: we want a deal as well but remind you we only hold money and it's not ours to use under any circumstance by law. the money that is ours cannot be used for non-banking expenses by law and what is left over after that is very little. we simply don't have the amount of money you demand but have offerred you a tremendous amount of money. take this deal and let's end this. gang: i cannot accept your amount. i'm sorry. victim: we are here when you want to do a deal. we have funds to pay just not in the range you are asking for. victim: hopefully then boat trip was relaxing on your end. we are ready to close the deal at 750k as we were successful in securing funds. let's close the deal and both of us can enjoy the rest of the weekend. thank you. gang: the best i can do for you is 5 million victim: you said you were going to send us the files tree. can you please send the partial tree. thank you. gang: yes i can gang: file: [1.7z] gang: file: [2.7z] gang: file: [3.7z] gang: file: [4.7z] gang: file: [9.png] gang: since all your files do not have names but are simply numbered for better security and handling and use of special programs, i made screenshots of some random files for you. gang: because of this policy of naming files it is hard to find the most valuable and compromising files of your company, but i was able to find a file that describes your money and the money of your investors, this amount exceeds 500 million dollars, so this once again confirms that you are evading taxes and 1 of this amount for me and keeping our secrets will be a perfectly fair amount. victim: our net revenue last year was 3 million. the document you provided has our clients money and we only hold the funds. we cannot access the funds as only our clients can. so, when we pay you in btc it goes into a wallet. your wallet is likely held at some brokerage firm. the brokerage firm cannot access your wallet and take that money. they are just holding the money and you are the one that controls it not us. when we report to our regulator, we must report the amount of funds we are holding. again this is loans and deposits that we cannot use and is reported to regulators. we are offering you 25 of our net revenue number of 3million. 750,000 is a sizeable sum. we want to get to a deal and will pay you quickly. so, hopefully you understand that we do not control the 500,000,000 number as it controlled by our members. we only can control the 3 million net revenue number and we are offering 25 of that sum. i do not know if other organizations are giving you this amount of their net revenue. we are a not-for-profit credit union. please understand that we want to settle and will pay you with funds we can control. can we conclude our affairs and move forward and pay you what we control. gang: hi, you're trying to trick me again, once again, the minimum possible ransom amount is 5 million. judging by your documents you regularly violate tax laws and evade taxes, you understate your profits, although in fact it is much higher, you are engaged in money laundering, this is the first thing. secondly as soon as all this becomes public, none of your investors will not trust you with money for your business, as well as the reputation as a credit institution will be forever and irrevocably ruined, your competitors will be very happy to download all the loan agreements and lure your clients to themselves, so please stop pissing in my ears, pay 5 million dollars and let's go as ships at sea in peace. victim: no one is trying to trick you and we are not pissing in your ears. your accusations are unfounded as we are audited by regulators every year. we have tried to explain our business model to you and you seem to not understand. we are a not for profit credit union and our net revenue last year was 3m. our records are public and you can look them up. we have told you we will give you 25 percent of our net revenue, which is 750k. we have been through your blog and companies with larger revenue than we have are charged less than you are asking from us. we are willing to sail in peace just modify your understanding of the situation and we will pay quickly. gang: 5,000,000 is the price. gang: http: lockbitapt2d73krlbewgv27tquljgxr33xbwwsp6rkyieto7u4ncead.onion post ikguyqjqkz5kb0nv63153472ed56e gang: i am tired of your lies, you have 21 hours to pay, after the timer expires all your information will be published publicly. gang: before you send 5 million to my wallet, send a 1 test payment please. gang: bc1qyuunv9pz6f4qpgd0c0wmenu9zhr6u57yjf4afd bitcoin wallet gang: good luck victim: the below link is from an independent source which confirms our net income of 3,593m for the year, which you can see on page 7 of the report. this is the money we have available to settle our affairs not the 500m in customer loans and deposits you continue to reference which you can see on pg.13 of the report and which isn t hidden from the authorities as you claim. please accept our offer and let's settle this once and for all. if you are financially motivated, then give us a realistic number as you are already receiving 25 percent of our net revenue. https: www.mossadams.com getmedia 7b751331-6788-43df-b8e2-bcf754e9d85e credit-union-index-wa-or.pdf gang: 5 million is a realistic figure for you and it is not up for discussion. pay up or you will lose your business. victim: in good faith, paying you 1,000 to extend the leak clock does nobody any good. we cannot pay 5m and we have tried to explain this to you multiple times. our net income is 3m. it seems like we have hit an impasse in our discussions. we do not understand how you can in good faith ask a company to pay more in net income than they made. it seems you want our business to go under. from a business perspective, we all win if you would lower your number and we sail our separate ways. if i could raise the amount to 1m, will this be enough to satisfy your demands. if so, i can talk further with the board about how to raise the additional amount. gang: talk to the board about 1 percent of your 500 million, you have three hours left. victim: the board has communicated that we only made 3million in net revenue last year and provided you third party references on it. we do not control the 500 million that you continue to reference as that is our client money. publishing us does no good on either party as we are both motivated to get to a solution. what other information can we provide you to demonstrate that we do not control the 500 million and only control the 3m. we are only a 100 person company. gang: i don't believe you. gang: bc1qyuunv9pz6f4qpgd0c0wmenu9zhr6u57yjf4afd bitcoin wallet to extend the timer by 1 day gang: send me 1,000. victim: look at the public record documents we sent to you in the last few messages. it lays it all out in financial details. i do not know what else we can provide you. that has all credit unions listed and anyone can access it. gang: public information is fake, the real information is contained in your documents, i have thousands of your documents, all documents do not have file names, if you tell me the document number in which your real reporting is contained it will be easier for us to check the information and compare it with public fake reports. gang: file: [bluff1.png] gang: you're a filthy liar, your net profit per month is 3-4 million dollars, that's just the information i could find now in one of your documents gang: file: [bluff2.png] gang: non-interest income another 5 million a month gang: the price for you will not be lower than 5 million. this conversation with you is over. gang: i hope the irs will properly deal with your company after leaking these documents. gang: and put in jail your management who reports three million a year gang: goodbye. victim: we just want to understand your position in that you will walk away from a million dollars which is 33 percent of our net revenue for payment of a decryption key. gang: why are you pretending to be an idiot? i gave you the documents that prove that your company has a hidden untaxed net profit of 4-5 million a month! victim: you continue to misinterpret our records, and this has drawn out our negotiations many days. we have nothing to hide in our financial records as they are public and regulators, third party auditors, investors, and others can view them at any time. the link we provided shows this. now, bluff 1 shows our cumulative net income for the year at 3.5m as of august 2022 cumulative means from january to today , the prior month s income rolls forward and we actually lost money in august. bluff 2 shows the cumulative year-to-date income as of august which is included in our 3.5m earnings to date and not a separate income number as you incorrectly assessed. all our financials can be found in the accounting drive, board reports folder by year and month. the balance sheet and income statement in the folder provides the financial picture. while you review these documents, please delay posting our information to your blog which will harm our negotiations. after you have read the documents, can we conclude our business. we just want to understand your position in that you will walk away from a million dollars which is 33 percent of our net revenue for payment of a decryption key. gang: okay, my boss agrees to 4 million. victim: now that you understand our financials. can we settle and we will send you 1 million. gang: ok my boss agrees to 1 million, only if you send it today, here is the bitcoin wallet, bc1qyuunv9pz6f4qpgd0c0wmenu9zhr6u57yjf4afd victim: in exchange for 1m we will receive all decryption keys, support, proof of data deletion, and a detailed explanation on how to broke into our system. victim: also, how long after payment will we receive the decryptor? gang: 1 million just for the decryption keys. all other items are paid separately and will cost 3 million. victim: ok, so you are saying we pay 1million for the keys and support. and if we want the data back, that is another 1million and the security report is 1m. gang: yes. you will receive a decryptor in 1 confirmation on the bitcoin network. victim: i appreciate that you have given us options here. need some time to discuss with the board and we have different time zones on what the meaning of send it today. gang: i live in new york city. my time is now 2:55 p.m., you have until 12 a.m. to make the transfer if you want to take advantage of the discount. victim: you realize we are on pdt not edt. gang: it would be easier if i told you that you have 10 hours to transfer the money. victim: when we structured this deal, it was supposed to be a package deal. on the data, can you provide us a file tree victim: if we are going to pay you this evening, can you stay online with questions that we have victim: we want to meet your deadline but need a few answers from you. thank you. victim: are you there. we are working on acquiring the funds you want for the decryptor. can you answer a few questions gang: 1 million dollars just a decryptor. gang: all other requests for an additional fee. gang: getting a tree of downloaded files from your network, deleting those files, not allowing those files to be published on our blog separately 1 million. gang: information about how we entered your network, as well as other vulnerabilities separately 1 million dollars. gang: what else do you want? gang: you don't have much time left, should i wait for your money today or not? victim: yes. you should wait. we receive the decryptor along with support. wallet is confirmed as bc1qyuunv9pz6f4qpgd0c0wmenu9zhr6u57yjf4afd victim: we are ready to go once you confirm the wallet victim: we have four hours left per your instructions. gang: i confirm wallet. victim: thank you. stand by. victim: we receive the decryptor after payment along with any support. correct gang: yes. correct. victim: we have sent payment victim: we are at 2 confirmations now. victim: the tranactions has been confirmed. please send the decryptor. gang: did you have any difficulty deciphering it? victim: the decryptor is not working properly for files in some locations of the computer such as c: program files , c: windows folder and more locations etc. can you give us a new decryptor which works on all the files on the system? gang: run decryptor as administrator victim: we are running the tool as system administrator and have an issue - the decryptor is not working properly for files in some locations of the computer such as c: program files , c: windows folder and more locations etc. can you give us a new decryptor which works on all the files on the system? gang: show me screenshot, it's impossible. victim: stand by victim: file: [image 1 .png] gang: strange folder name samples from mn-dc003 gang: i think it is because the user does not have enough rights to change the system files in the system folders. there are two variants here, either try to run the decryptor with different permissions, e.g. from the system or another administrator, or copy the files to the desktop and decrypt them. gang: i also need to know the model of the operating system on which you are observing this problem, i will do lab work and try to reproduce the situation. gang: also please give me the md5 hash sum of your decryptor gang: maybe the decryptor got corrupted during the download. victim: we ve also tested copying encrypted files into multiple folders deep with all permissions changed to full access to all users,everyone,domain users, etc. the decryptor does not decrypt anything outside of the folder that it s located in. victim: i will acquire the items you are asking for victim: windows 11 , md5 hash of lbb decryptor.exe: 5cb062a9833428b118121b987099cc28 victim: can you fix the file path on the decryption so it will run everywhere or does it have a command line that we can point it to victim: please let's know what else you need so we can work the problem and fix our network victim: any update on this. gang: yes gang: please make a video recording as you decrypt, hundreds of companies successfully decrypt their data and only you allegedly encountered difficulties, it seems to me that you are lying as you like to do it. victim: file: [decrypt tool fail log.txt] victim: we would like to be one of your successful companies and never chat again if the decryptor worked as we thought it would. we have no reason to lie as we paid a significant sum for it. we will create the video. we did create a log file that shows when the decryptor run that the files do not decrypt. gang: it is very interesting to see your video. gang: i am also very curious why in your created log file there is no file in the folders that you stated, and gave a screenshot, such as program files gang: it would be interesting to see in the videos how you create the log file and how you try to decrypt the many files in the program files folder and others. victim: we are getting close to decrypting all files but have some issues with these last remaining ones. we can't post to the chat because the file is too large. here is our link to the files for you to take a look at. thank you. victim: https: file.io dhxwmcmmn5by gang: you keep ignoring my questions, i'm waiting for a video of you getting the log file and trying to decrypt files that are in the system folders. like the program files, for example victim: yes we will get you the video with the system files being ignored soon, meanwhile we were able to use the commandline version of the tool and --path command and point it to specific paths to fix the issue where the gui was ignoring some paths. the sample file sent is a file where the decryption failed no matter the path the file is located at gang: i'll ask you to edit your video faster, i'm already getting tired of this circus. gang: while you are in the business of tampering with evidence i will ask you just one question, will you pay to have your information removed or can i already publish the stolen information and our correspondence? victim: we are getting tired as well from the circus. we were able to make strides in decryption. however we hit a snag and wanted your help. we will get the video to you victim: we would like to understand the data you have and you promised us a partial file tree. if you can send us the partial file tree, we will discuss the amount you want with this victim: we appreciate you taking your time with us. victim: link to video: https: file.io hp89vy5pmjw5 gang: why are you copying encrypted files into the system folders and trying to decrypt them? you told me that you cannot decrypt files that were already in the system folders, not the ones you are copying there. gang: i sent you some files, from the file tree makes no sense, all files have only ordinal numbers and have no names. gang: price is not negotiable, either you pay 1 million or not pay, make a decision today please. victim: we told you we could not decrypt and were showing you the issue as the decryptor would not go down to a folder level. we finally figured it out however another issue come up with the file we sent you as it will not decrypt. gang: you're trying to trick me, i've known that for a long time, but i wondered what ridiculous evidence you'd provide. gang: recycle.bin;config.msi; windows. bt; windows.

you a list of files as soon as you pay. victim: we told you - show us the file tree gang: i told you, your files have no names, there are only numbers instead of file names, the file tree makes no

gang: send me some encrypted files, i will decrypt them for free. gang: i see you're not in rush having business with us. i don't think it's in your interest to be penalized for that. gang: if you keep quiet i will start to leak your data victim: it take time to collect files wait please victim: file: [laval encrypted files.zip] victim: file: [sayabec encrypted files.zip] victim: can you show me the files you took and what your demands are?

victim: can you remove our post? victim: our board has agreed to offer 500k to close this incident. do we have a deal? gang: because it semms you don't want to make a deal and waisting time gang: the blog private now, i just want you know that i'm not joking with you gang: the amount is nothing for such a company. you have a time until tomorrow to make a real offer. otherwise i will put a blog to a public page. victim: we know that. victim: but you see? i told you that you do not understand our situation so why even ask for an offer? victim: look i just need to tell my management something. are you able to provide a more reasonable price or not? the fact you already published means the company needs to take calls from the media. gang: what was you doing last week?

victim: i hope to hear from management very soon gang: hurry up victim: just completed a board discussion and the board is willing to settle this at 1.5m this is a big increase as you can see from our former amount but we hope you can see how serious we are to address the situation in an amicable fashion. gang: i can't access that amount gang: i see you're not impressed an effect of our blog post. tomorrow the blog will be available again with. i don't care if it will not increase the offer but at least next time the recovery company will make things faster victim: i am awaiting our management executive to confirm what is possible in terms of an amount for this case. you have to understand we are looking at data and cost of the incident to us. i will likely respond to you tomorrow. if you publish us again, it will have no more impact that your publication already did. victim: we scheduled an afternoon board meeting as i am at my limit from a perspective. i will be in touch tomorrow afternoon evening time frame. gang: so what?

if you try to decrypt or change your files - you will destroy all the information. we hope to reach an agreement. thank you. victim: that price is very high for us. gang: of course, the price is high, but it is much, much more cheaper, than pay to all the lawsuits, that your clients will send to you, because you have lost so much of their data. companies of your size can lost tens of millions in such cases. https: www.zdnet.com article easyjet-faces-18-billion-class-action-lawsuit-over-data-breach this is one of the examples gang: we also inform you that before payment you can decrypt any file not exceeding 5mb as a test, we are also ready to provide a small amount of data downloaded from your network. in the future, after payment, we will provide you with a complete log tree, information on how the attack was carried out, as well as comprehensive recommendations from technical specialists. we also guarantee the deletion of all downloaded data and the provision of decryption keys for your entire network. gang: in case of refusal, all information will become public including confidential http: mountnewsokhwilx.onion , the recovery keys will be deleted. we also remind you that your time is limited ... victim: we want to handle this in a professional way. to avoid confusion please only communicate with us on this website only, and stop all other communications to us outside of this chat. the price you suggest is too high. we would like to come to an agreeable term to clear this up quickly. gang: we appreciate your desire to resolve this situation quickly and are waiting for your specific proposals? victim: thank you for your professionalism. we researched your group and we know you are serious people. please please understand that between covid and the california wildfires, our revenue is already decimated this year. this is just going to do us in. our staff have been through a lot. we would hope you would keep that in mind when offering any kind of discount. the amount you have asked is just huge. we don t have that kind of money available. is there anything we can do to move this to something more achievable? gang: unfortunately, covid-19 has affected all industries, but we sincerely hope that you will not only recover in the near future, but also earn much more. we made you the best offer, but i never heard from you the opposite taking into account all the circumstances ... gang: here we prepared some proofs. https: privatlab.com s v [redacted] pass: zxcffk ! uh,;l;l gang: just small amount of your private data, including claims, personal info, contacts with mobile phones, addresses, date of birth, therapy and other sensitive data. head of your partners companies, which surely be happy of their personal info got published online. they all have lawyers and they like courts, which very like legal fines. gang: amount of money we want is just a small piece of your possible losses including but not limiting direct expenses such as payments for data recovery, dramatic cash flow drop, legal government fines, attorneys lawyers interests, but also reputation impact resulting in long-term customer abandonment. gang: but there is another option. after payment you get decryptor tool returning you in business within 1-2 hours with instruction , security report with advice how to prevent such incidents in future, full directory listing of your stolen private info, complete data deletion. no data will be posted ever. everything will be kept in secret. gang: according to your financial reports your situation is much better than you say. as a group with an estimated yearly revenue 1billion you have enough money to pay us. victim: we have researched your group and your capabilities. however, your revenue numbers for our company are incorrect. yes, everyone was hit with covid, but my staff was forced to evacuate due to wildfires, and even after, we could barely breathe the air outside for weeks. we would ask that you consider 900,000. gang: we don't think, that our estimates are incorrect. your financial reports are somewhat more reliable, than your word here and now. and your proposal here is just from the textbooks - ten times less, than our initial demand. it seems, that you do not understand, how works our group. we don't ask 90 millions, to receive our demand of 9 millions. evacuation of your staff due to the wildfires, and complain about breath is not worth 90 of the demand. for now, it does not worth even 5 of our demand, before we get some real proposal. so you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. if we don't reach an agreement, we'll just shorten our profit. and on other hand, you would be ruined. that is much more serious threat, than the wildfires. we'll wait for your proposal. sincerely, yours. victim: thank you for getting back to us so quickly. we can tell how professional you are. please understand that the financial numbers you are looking at are in indian rupees not us dollars. that is a huge difference. your current demand is just not something our company can afford. i am trying to convince my board to make a better offer to you and we are looking to make a deal with you for sure, but we need you to please work with us. there must be a lesser amount we can pay you. gang: of course, we too want to work with you. and of course, we can talk about a lesser amount. but to start to rapidly move in that direction, we want to see a good, respectful starting offer from you. please understand, that sum of about 1 million is regarded as an insult by my bosses. so we look forward to continue our negotiations on more acceptable terms. victim: thank you for your consideration towards a lesser amount. please let me discuss with the board of directors to understand what may be viable gang: ok, lets see what you can offer. and jfyi - we know that your financial reports are in [redacted currency] and we know exchange rates. we have also have huge experience in that business and understanding how much your private data costs including sources of you software which could become public via github. anyway both of us are business people and count money very well. victim: we are trying to get together resources to make a better offer, we appreciate your patience. victim: we ve discussed this with the board and our finance team. we can pay 1,746,800. getting an extra 846,800 was not easy. it required the approval of all board members. it took time for us to convince all members. we believe it is a fair and reasonable offer and it will be very difficult to get any more for you. gang: thank you for your efforts, now i see, that we can start moving towards you. it is fair and reasonable first offer, and i glad, that we have now a chance to successfully negotiate. we are ready to make a discount of 1 million us dollars, so your price is now 8'000'000. of course, we understand, that your work here is not easy and requires efforts to convince your board members. but we are still far from agreement. our estimates are still much higher, than your proposal. we hope, that you will give us better price. and since it is our mutual interest to speed up our negotiations as much, as we can - take more serious steps toward us. it would be much easier than for us to make steps to you in response. victim: thank you for your response and your willingness to negotiate with us. i got a lot of pushback trying to find more funds. we just found out our insurance does not cover this cost, so all money is coming from our reserves. we were already dealing with dwindling revenue and clients are not signing new contracts. this is very difficult. please, 2,350,000 and we can get this done. gang: we've discussed your proposal with team, and we are ready to make another discount. understanding that you have some issues with signing new contracts, your price is now 7'500'000. of course, we are ready to move on further, depending on your offers. time is crucial here, so the more serious steps you will take in our direction, the faster we will get an agreement. we understand, that any downtime of your business is not in your interests, it is quite costly. possible losses, however, are much more expensive. but in fact, your downtime is not in our interests too, i can assure you. we know, that you have insurance, reserves, and possibility of loans. your overall reserve is quite better, than your proposal. make better offer, and we will move on. victim: thank you for your response and your lower price. we appreciate how professional you are. i am going back to my board now, but the last request took a lot of time and effort. you said you have 500gb of our data. is there proof you can give me that i can take to my board to help try to get more funds? gang: 2020-10-25: https: privatlab.com s v [redacted] pass:[redacted] thank you for keeping in touch. we've already sent you proofs. private data like ssn, dob of your staff, data of clients, their diagnoses and your top-management data, source codes of your projects are not enough? we perfectly understand, that you are following the tutorial, no offence by that. staff data doesn't worth anything for you. but if you need some points for your board... you already have issues with your dwindling revenue and shortage of new contracts. but if we will just say for a moment, that there is an announcement on our news site and the rest of the cartel news sites , that your company had lost private data of your us customers, and source codes of your clients... us part of the revenue will go to zero, just as number of possible new contracts. we've already done such things before, and our customers were forced to face the grim consequences. we think, that there is no point in efforts to display more proofs. situation is perfectly clear and we're already in the middle of negotiations. of course, we just want to make money, and not to destroy business of our clients. we hope, that your board have enough commerce sense to make right choices. we're waiting for another good offer and are ready to move towards you, if it is good enough. victim: thank you for your willingness to negotiate and continue working with us. this is very difficult for me. i have never been under so much stress ever. please, we are getting to the point where our finances are very pressured with the loss of business. our board is eager to get this done and has approved up to 3,095,400, this a big increase and a very good offer to you. can we please settle at this number? gang: we've discussed your offer with team. as a token of respect for your efforts to move on our negotiations, our boss had approved huge discount of 2'500'000 to speed up our bargaining. your fast responding made such terms real. so as we make serious step to you, your price is hold now at a point of 5'000'000. we think that as a fair offer in comparison to your possible losses. let us be professionals and settle at this number. we look forward to your answer. victim: first, thank you very much for being reasonable. i believe that we are very close here. i only have certain authority. anything more will take more convincing and more time. if we could settle at 3,771,100 the exact amount of everything that i have been able to locate for you , we can get you all the money or crypto as soon as tomorrow monday . it is sunday today . if you require more, i will need more time. please can we make this a deal for 3,771,100? gang: we see that we are very close to a deal. lets make an additional discount and total amount will be 4,500,000. victim: thank you for being so reasonable. you have me at my very end. i have gotten every authority i can get. there is no more. i have 4,110,500 to pay you. this is a huge amount of money much much more than i ever imagined when we began. please confirm that for this amount, we will receive all decryption keys and your technical recommendations, a list of all our files you have taken, evidence from you that all our files you have taken are permanently deleted, and some kind of report from you explaining how you got into our system. gang: we will provide you with a bitcoin wallet here in the chat. -

gang: bitcoin takes some time to receive basically victim: ah, ok, its a bitcoin thing. let me know when its confirmed, thanks gang: the payment confirmed. thank you for your business. the affiliate should provide the security report. gang: defend your credentials from mimikatz limit administrator privileges to the smallest group possible. even if you have thousands of user accounts, you should probably only have 2-5 administrator accounts. start with two accounts and force users to justify any additional accounts added to the administrator group. the next thing that you should do is upgrade the schema and functional level of your forest and domain to at least 2012 r2. this domain functional level adds a fairly new group called protected users . along with other protections, the members of the protected users group cannot authenticate by using ntlm, digest authentication, or credssp. these changes provide powerful protections that make mimikatz almost worthless. verify kb2871997 has been installed to apply additional required security. after you install this security update, the default setting for non-protected users on windows 7 and windows 8 is to not force clear leaked logon session credentials. gang: to override this default you can add the following registry dword, tokenleakdetectdelaysecs, and set it to a recommended value of 30 seconds. hkey local machine system currentcontrolset control lsa stop storing passwords in memory by changing the uselogoncredential registry setting to 0 instead of the default value of 1 and passwords are no longer available to mimikatz . hkey local machine system currentcontrolset control securityproviders wdigest start monitoring your systems for unauthorized software and malware, which should help identify mimikatz installation and activity. you ll have to test these changes to see what breaks, but the idea is to implement some fairly basic changes to protect your network. in your specific case the critical vulnerabiliry contained forti vpn, please update fortivpn and monitor for updates and windows updates. inform your it stuff to remove the posibility of storing user passwords within the network. gang: also we recommend you to use sentinelav and dattoo backup system. also veeam tapes is good ,but pc with veeam should be in workgroup and user should be different from main domain. every pc should have av. don't let any pc without av. also try configure 2fa at all network pc when you connect to remote desktop. use password on av. also tip for you: if you want chage fortigate vpn to other . we dont reccomend you to use sonic vpn,pulse secure, because its under massive hack gang: and finally, update your exchange server, since it was the main entry point. gang: as for data, we instructed an erasure and it was confirmed all your data is erased. so you are safe. thank you for your business. victim: ok, thank you for all of these items and confirming deletion. i gave the decryptor package to our it and i will reach out if we have any technical issues. thank you. gang: it'd be better for your it to reach out directly if possible if anything's to occur",5,-0.16,hostile

gang: we understand that the company can afford to pay 100 00, we went to you for the purchase and made a big discount gang: 100 000 victim: i'll talk with them gang: ok, also if they have insurance, this will not incur financial losses for them at all, the insurance will pay everything victim: they don't have an insurance gang: well then, i advise you to buy it in the future. victim: in italy with the italian law it's hard to cash out this amount. with difficulties we can arrive to 65k. gang: we had clients from italy who could easily pay 350,000, let's stop at 85k, it will be optimal for you and us! victim: i'm talking with them. please 5 minutes gang: ok victim: btw just genuinely asking: how did they pay you such an amount? i can't imagine a way to move 350k from italy in few days, it's just really difficult unless it happens via bank wire gang: they worked with the bank, we cannot tell you the company, for the reason: they paid, we keep secret information about our clients who made the transaction victim: sure, as i said i was just asking out of curiosity. anyway, we convinced them to make an effort for 85k usd, since it's in the interest of their business. gang: okay, do you need instructions on how to buy bitcoin? or will you do everything yourself? victim: i'll speak with them to understand how they want buy it gang: ok victim: can you give us your instruction to pay you? gang: there are bitcoin atms in italy, you can use it or buy bitcoins on the exchange https: www.finder.com it how-to-buy-bitcoins, or find a private bitcoin broker in italy this is the safest option as soon as you are ready to transfer i will give you a wallet victim: ok do you know i can do with an atm and where i can find it and use it to give the money gang: https: coinatmradar.com country 105 bitcoin-atm-italy victim: ok thanks victim: we have some questions victim: 1 is it ok for you if they proceed via coin atm? do you know if they can directly transfer funds to your wallet via the atm, or do they need to purchase coins and them separately transfer them? victim: 2 once the decryption process begins, they obviously need some form of warranty that everything is working. as for what we could see, your software encrypted files, destroyed filesystem shadow copies and compromised backups. what kind of technical warranty can you provide that everything will work smoothly even for big files full vm disks and lan backup? victim: and 3 given that we have an agreement, could you delete the post you published [redacted]? this would prevent the company from having to move on with legal procedures, which they are legally compelled to follow if they have notice of a data breach. if you delete that post, there will no longer be any evidence, and they will be able to avoid this. gang: 1 for atm, you'd better top up your wallet and then send us 2 file size doesn't matter, we made all required tests before encrypt your network gang: 3 post will be removed today gang: the decryptor works the same as the encryptor only in the other direction victim: ok thanks, we'll start with the work gang: during the day, the moderator of [redacted] will delete the topic, i wrote him a private message and also wrote in the topic, you can check it victim: thank you, we will get back to you soon gang: ok victim: ok thanks gang: threads [redacted] -deleted, please cheked victim: cheked, thanks! we are buying the btc. i'll ping you asap victim: hi gang: hello, when you will have required amount of bitcoin's write here victim: yes gang: you ready to pay?
